                    <p class="noindent">Congratulations on choosing to become a Certified
                        Information Systems Auditor (CISA). Whether you have worked for several
                        years in the field of information systems auditing or have just recently
                        been introduced to the world of controls, assurance, and security, don’t
                        underestimate the hard work and dedication required to obtain and
                        maintain CISA certification. Although ambition and motivation are
                        essential, the rewards of being CISA certified can far exceed the
                        effort.</p>
                    <p class="indentt">You probably never imagined you would find yourself
                        working in the world of auditing or looking to obtain a professional
                        auditing certification. Perhaps the increase in legislative or
                        regulatory requirements for information system security led to your
                        introduction to this field. Or possibly you noticed that CISA-related
                        career options are increasing exponentially and you have decided to get
                        ahead of the curve. You aren’t alone: since the inception of CISA
                        certification in 1978, more than 129,000 professionals worldwide reached
                        the same conclusion and have earned this well-respected certification.
                        In 2009 and again in 2017, <em>SC Magazine</em> named CISA certification
                        the winner of the <em>Best Professional Certification Program</em>, and
                        in 2014 it was a finalist for the same award. The 2016 Global Knowledge
                        <em>IT Skills and Salary Report</em>, as well as a recent <em>IT Skills
                            and Certifications Pay Index</em> (ITSCPI) from Foote Partners, show
                        the CISA certification among the highest-paying IT certifications.
                        Welcome to the journey and the amazing opportunities that await you.

                    <p class="indent">I have put together this information to help you
                        understand the commitment needed, prepare for the exam, and maintain
                        your certification. Not only is it my wish that you prepare for and pass
                        the exam with flying colors, but I also provide you with the information
                        and resources to maintain your certification and to represent yourself
                        and the professional world of information system (IS) auditing proudly
                        with your new credentials.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><span id="page_2" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>ISACA
                        (formerly known as the Information Systems Audit and Control
                        Association) is a recognized leader in the areas of control, assurance,
                        and IT governance. Formed in 1967, this nonprofit organization
                        represents more than 140,000 professionals in more than 180 countries.
                        ISACA administers several exam certifications, including the CISA, the
                        Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), the Certified in Risk and
                        Information Systems Control (CRISC), and the Certified in the Governance
                        of Enterprise IT (CGEIT) certifications. The certification program
                        itself has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute
                        (ANSI) under International Organization for Standardization and
                        International Electrotechnical Commission standard ISO/IEC 17024:2012,
                        which means that ISACA’s procedures for accreditation meet international
                        requirements for quality, continuous improvement, and accountability.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">If you’re new to ISACA, I recommend that you tour the
                        organization’s web site (<a data-savepage-href="http://www.isaca.org"
                            href="http://www.isaca.org/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">www.isaca.org</a>) and become familiar
                        with the guides and resources available. In addition, if you’re near one
                        of the 200-plus local ISACA chapters in more than 80 countries
                        worldwide, consider taking part in the activities and even reaching out
                        to the chapter board for information on local meetings, training days,
                        conferences, or study sessions. You may be able to meet other IS
                        auditors who can give you additional insight into the CISA certification
                        and the audit profession.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Established in 1978, the CISA certification primarily
                        focuses on audit, controls, assurance, and security. It certifies the
                        individual’s knowledge of testing and documenting IS controls and his or
                        her ability to conduct formal IS audits. Organizations seek out
                        qualified personnel for assistance with developing and maintaining
                        strong control environments. A CISA-certified individual is a great
                        candidate for this.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Through the phenomenon of digital transformation,
                        organizations in every industry sector around the world are becoming
                        increasingly reliant on information systems for daily business
                        operations. Further, the upward trend in IT outsourcing in the form of
                        Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and
                        Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings means organizations are put
                        in a position of having to trust those service providers that the SaaS,
                        PaaS, and IaaS platforms are secure. This reliance compels organizations
                        to rely heavily on IS auditors to provide assurances that IT
                        environments have the necessary security, integrity, and resilience that
                        today’s organizations require.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3" id="chlev1">Benefits of CISA Certification</h3>
                    <p class="noindent">Obtaining the CISA certification offers several
                        significant benefits:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Expands knowledge and skills,
                            builds confidence</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing knowledge and
                        skills in the areas of audit, controls, assurance, and security can
                        prepare you for advancement or expand your scope of responsibilities.
                        The personal and professional achievement can boost confidence that
                        encourages you to move forward and seek new career opportunities.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Increases marketability and
                            career options</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of various legal
                        and regulatory requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability
                        and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Payment Card Industry Data Security
                        Standard (PCI-DSS), Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
                        (GLBA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), <span id="page_3"

                        California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), along with the growing need for
                        information systems and automation, controls, assurance, and audit

                        developing, documenting, and testing controls. In addition, obtaining
                        your CISA certification demonstrates to current and potential employers
                        your willingness and commitment to improve your knowledge and skills in
                        information systems auditing. Having a CISA can provide a competitive
                        advantage and open up many doors of opportunity in various industries
                        and countries.</p>

                        requires that all certificate holders have a current security audit
                        certification, either CISA or ISO 27001 Lead Auditor.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Helps you meet employment

                        require CISA certifications for positions involving IS audit activities.
                        DoD Directive 8140.01 (formerly DoD Directive 8570.01-M) mandates that
                        those personnel performing information assurance activities within the
                        agency are certified with a commercial accreditation approved by the
                        DoD. The DoD has approved the ANSI-accredited CISA certificate program
                        because it meets ISO/IEC 17024:2012 requirements. All Information
                        Assurance Technical (IAT) Level III personnel are mandated to obtain
                        CISA certification, as are those who are contracted to perform similar
                        activities.</p>

                        of the audits and controls documented or tested are in line with
                        internationally recognized standards.</p>

                        limit you to auditing; it can provide additional value and insight to

                        <p class="noindent">You’re probably noticing the use of the terms “IS”
                            and “IT” in this chapter. Indeed, you’ll find these terms throughout
                            the entire book. IS means <em>information systems</em>, an inclusive
                            term that can mean a single computer, its operating system, an
                            application running on the system, a network device, a virtual
                            machine, or a collection of systems that work together to fulfill
                            some purpose. In the world of auditing information systems, a person
                            who examines information systems is an IS auditor.</p>
                        <p class="indent">Notice also that the letters “IS” in CISA stand for
                            <em>information systems</em>, not <em>information security</em>, as
                            is sometimes believed. A CISA is expected to know how to audit all
                            aspects of an information system, not just security controls used to
                            protect systems and information.
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent">IT means <em>information technology</em> and refers to
                            the technology found in computers, software, storage systems, and
                            applications. In most organizations, the group of people who manage
                            information technology is known as the IT department. Some
                            organizations, however, ascribe the term IS department.</p>
                        <p class="indent">Often, IS and IT are used interchangeably, and
                            generally, such usage is not considered inappropriate or incorrect.

                    <p class="noindent">An auditor can gather information from several credible
                        resources to conduct an audit with integrity and confidence. ISACA has
                        developed its own set of standards of mandatory requirements for IS
                        auditing and reporting, known as the ITAF: Information Technology
                        Assurance Framework.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><span id="page_9" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>ITAF offers
                        multiple levels of IS audit and assurance guidance: standards,
                        guidelines, and tools and techniques. Standards are higher level
                        <em>mandatory</em> requirements that inform IS audit and assurance
                        professionals of minimal performance expectations. Guidelines provide
                        additional guidance in applying the standards, while tools and
                        techniques provide examples of procedures that audit and assurance
                        professionals may follow.

                    <p class="indent">As a CISA, you are required to abide by and promote the IS
                        standards where applicable, encouraging compliance and supporting their
                        implementation. As you prepare for certification and beyond, you will
                        need to read through and become familiar with these standards. These
                        standards were created to define the minimum level of acceptable
                        performance needed to meet the professional requirements as defined by
                        ISACA and to help set expectations. They have been established, vetted,

                        throughout the year in periods known as <em>testing windows</em> that
                        are generally several months in length. The ISACA web site will have
                        information about current testing windows and sometimes about future
                        testing windows. When you begin planning for your CISA examination,
                        you’ll want to consult the ISACA web site to see what scheduling options
                        are available in your testing window. Other terms and conditions change
                        from time to time, from one testing window to the next.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In 2019, the schedule of exam fees in U.S. dollars was</p>

                        receive an e-mail acknowledging your registration, and within four weeks
                        of processing you will receive a hard copy of the letter and a
                        registration receipt in the mail. Two to three weeks prior to the test
                        date you will receive an exam admission ticket via e-mail and regular
                        mail. You will need the admission ticket to enter the test site—be sure
                        to keep it unmarked and in a safe place until test time.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each registrant has four hours to take the

                        question has four answer choices; test-takers can select only one best
                        answer by clicking it. You will be scored for each job practice area and
                        then provided one final score. Before you close out the computerized

                        scores are scaled. Scores range from 200 to 800; however, a final score
                        of 450 is required to pass.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Exam questions are derived from a job practice analysis

                        During this time, periodically take practice exams and note your areas

                        the Internet reveals a variety of web sites that cater to teaching
                        individuals how to cram for exams most effectively. There are also
                        research sites claiming that exam cramming can lead to susceptibility to
                        colds and flu, sleep disruptions, overeating, and digestive problems.
                        One thing is certain: many people find that good, steady study habits
                        result in less stress and greater clarity and focus during the exam.
                        Because of the complexity of this exam, I highly recommend the
                        long-term, steady-study option. Study the job practice areas thoroughly.
                        There are many study options. If time permits, investigate the many

                        the schedule for the day of the exam. If you are driving, know the route
                        and know where to park your vehicle.</p>

                        of the Exam</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Consider the following list of tips that can help you on
                        exam day:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Arrive
                            early</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the Candidate Information
                        Guide and your admission ticket for the exact time you are required to
                        report to the test site. The ticket and the Candidate Information Guide
                        explain that you must be at the test site <em>no later</em> than
                        approximately 30 minutes <em>before</em> testing time. If you are late,
                        you may miss your opportunity to take the exam on that day, and you’ll
                        have to reschedule your exam.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Observe test center
                            rules</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be rules about taking
                        breaks. This will be discussed by the examiner along with exam
                        instructions. If at any time during the exam you need something and are
                        unsure as to the rules, be sure to ask first. For information on conduct
                        during the exam, see <a href="http://www.isaca.org/cisabelongings"

                            questions</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read questions carefully, but do
                        not try to overanalyze. Remember to select the <em>best</em> solution.
                        There may be several reasonable answers, but one is <em>better</em> than
                        the others.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev10">After the Exam</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Although you’ll be shown your preliminary pass/fail
                        results when you have completed and closed your exam, you will receive
                        your official exam results by e-mail or regular mail within a few weeks
                        from the date of the exam. Each job practice area score will be noted in
                        addition to the overall final score. Should you receive a passing score,
                        you will also receive the application for certification.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Those unsuccessful in passing will also be notified. These
                        individuals will want to take a close look at the job practice area
                        scores to determine areas for further study. They may retake the exam as
                        many times as needed on future exam dates, as long as they have
                        registered and paid the applicable fees. Regardless of pass or fail,
                        exam results will not be disclosed via telephone, fax, or e-mail (with
                        the exception of the consented one-time e-mail notification).</p>

                    <p class="noindent">To apply for certification, you must be able to submit
                        evidence of a passing score and related work experience. Keep in mind
                        that once you receive a passing score, you have five years to use this
                        score on a CISA application. After this time, you will need to take the
                        exam again. In addition, all work experience submitted must have been
                        within ten years of your new certification application.</p>

                        complete the application process, you need to submit the following

                        control, security experience, and/or any experience substitutions; and
                        identify which ISACA job practice area(s) the experience pertains to.

                        signed by your immediate supervisor or a person of higher rank in the
                        organization to verify work experience noted on the application. You
                        must fill out a complete set of Work Experience forms for each separate

                    <p class="indent">As with the exam, after you’ve successfully mailed the
                        application, you must wait approximately eight weeks for processing. If
                        your application is approved, you will receive a package in the mail
                        containing your letter of certification, a certificate, and a copy of
                        the Continuing Education Policy. You can then proudly display your
                        certificate and use the designation (“CISA”) on your CV, résumé, e-mail
                        profile, or business cards.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3" id="chlev12">Retaining Your CISA Certification</h3>
                    <p class="noindent">There is more to becoming a CISA than merely passing an
                        exam, submitting an application, and receiving a paper certificate.
                        Being a CISA is an ongoing lifestyle. Those with the CISA certification
                        not only agree to abide by the Code of Professional Ethics and adhere to
                        the IS standards, but they must also meet ongoing education requirements
                        and pay certification maintenance fees. Let’s take a closer look at the
                        education requirements and explain the fees involved in retaining
                        certification.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev13">Continuing Education</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">The goal of continuing professional education (CPE)
                        requirements is to ensure that individuals maintain CISA-related
                        knowledge so that they can better manage, assess, and design controls
                        around IS. To maintain CISA certification, individuals must obtain 120
                        CPE hours within three years, with a minimum requirement of 20 hours per
                        year. Each CPE hour is to account for 50 minutes of active participation
                        in educational activities.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">What Counts as a Valid CPE Credit?</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">In order for training and activities to be utilized for
                        CPEs, they must involve technical or managerial training that is
                        directly applicable to IS assessments, audit, controls, or security. The
                        following list of activities has been approved by the CISA certification
                        committee and can count toward your CPE requirements:</p>

                        and meetings.</p>

                        <em>ISACA Journal</em> CPE Quizzes online or participate in monthly
                        webcasts. For each webcast, CPEs are rewarded after you pass a quiz.

                        for the annual renewal process, but you also should keep detailed
                        records for each activity. Records associated with each activity should
                        include the following:</p>

                    <p class="indent">It is in your best interest to track all CPE information
                        in a single document or worksheet. ISACA has developed a Verification of

                            rel="noopener noreferrer">www.isaca.org/cisacpepolicy</a>. To make
                        it easy on yourself, consider keeping all related records such as
                        receipts, brochures, and certificates in the same place. Retain
                        documentation throughout the three-year certification period and for one
                        additional year afterward. This is especially important, because you may
                        someday be audited. If this happens, you would be required to submit all
                        paperwork. So why not be prepared?</p>
                    <p class="indent">For new CISAs, the annual and three-year certification
                        period begins January 1 of the year following certification. You are not
                        required to report CPE hours for the first partial year after your
                        certification; however, the hours earned from the time of certification
                        to December 31 can be utilized in the first certification reporting
                        period the following year. Therefore, should you get certified in
                        January, you will have until the following January to accumulate CPEs
                        and will not have to report them until you report the totals for the
                        <span id="page_16" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>following year, which
                        will be in October or November. This is known as the <em>renewal
                            period</em>. During this time, you will receive an e-mail directing
                        you to the web site to enter CPEs earned over the course of the year.
                        Alternatively, the renewal will be mailed to you, and you can record
                        CPEs on the hard-copy invoice and send them with your maintenance fee
                        payment. CPEs and maintenance fees must be received by January 15 to
                        retain certification.

                    <p class="indent">Notification of compliance from the certification
                        department is sent after all of the information has been received and
                        processed. Should ISACA have any questions about the information you

                    <p class="noindent">To remain CISA certified, you must pay CPE maintenance
                        fees each year. These fees are (as of 2019) $45 for members and $85 for
                        nonmembers each year. These fees are in <span id="page_17"

                    <p class="noindent">A CISA-certified individual may have his or her
                        certification revoked for the following reasons:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to complete the minimum number
                        of CPEs during the required period.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to document and provide evidence
                        of CPEs in an audit.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to submit payment for maintenance
                        fees.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to comply with the Code of
                        Professional Ethics; this can result in investigation and ultimately
                        lead to revocation of certification.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you have received a revocation notice, you will need to
                        contact the ISACA Certification Department at <a

                    <p class="noindent">Following are a few general pointers for exam prep:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Register for the exam early to ensure
                        that you can take the exam at a location and date of your choosing.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When studying for the exam, take as many
                        practice exams as possible.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorization will not work—for this exam,
                        it is critical that you understand the concepts.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have time while studying for the
                        exam, begin gathering relevant Work Experience Verification forms from
                        past employers and original transcripts from your college or university
                        (if using the education experience waiver).</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not arrive late to the exam site.
                        Latecomers are immediately disqualified and they forfeit exam fees.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin keeping track of CPEs as soon as
                        you obtain certification.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark your calendar for CPE renewal time,
                        which begins in October/November each year and ends January 15. Don’t
                        wait for the e-mail; set your own reminder.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become familiar with the Code of
                        Professional Ethics and IS standards.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become involved in your local ISACA
                        chapter for networking and educational opportunities.</p>

                    <p class="noindent">Becoming and being a CISA is a lifestyle, not just a
                        one-time event. It takes motivation, skill, good judgment, and
                        proficiency to be a strong leader in the world of information systems
                        auditing. The CISA was designed to help you navigate the IS auditing
                        world with greater ease and confidence.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In the following chapters, each CISA job practice area is
                        discussed in detail, and additional reference material is presented. Not
                        only is this information useful for studying prior to the exam, but it
                        is also meant to serve as a resource throughout your career as an audit
                        professional.</p>
