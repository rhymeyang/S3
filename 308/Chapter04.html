                    <p class="noindent">Organizations employ business processes to organize
                        the tasks related to the development and maintenance of application
                        software and the supporting IT infrastructure. Business processes
                        provide constraint and management control for high-value activities
                        such as the acquisition, development, and maintenance of software
                        and infrastructure, and these processes also provide the structure
                        for projects and project management.</p>
                    <p class="indentt">Organizations, for the most part, have undergone
                        significant transformation in the past decade with regard to the
                        nature of their business software applications. In the past,
                        organizations developed or acquired software applications, heavily
                        customized them with an internal staff of programmers, and operated
                        them in on-premises data centers (once known as computer rooms).
                        Contrast to today, where most organizations employ
                        Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business applications with integrations
                        among them, and with few, if any, software developers on staff. The
                        emphasis on the software development life cycle has now given way to
                        the systems development (really, acquisition) life cycle.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Many organizations recognize that business processes
                        themselves have the same intricacies as software, and that life
                        cycle management is appropriate for, and similar to, the life cycle
                        for software development. They also realize that business processes
                        and application software are often tightly coupled and must often be
                        managed as complex, multifaceted single entities.</p>

                        auditors should pay particular attention to an organization’s
                        methodologies and practices for the acquisition, development, and
                        management of software, infrastructure, and business processes. This
                        is valuable information regarding the effectiveness of an
                        organization’s life cycle management and helps auditors determine
                        how well the organization develops requirements and can transform
                        them into applications and infrastructure that effectively support
                        key business processes.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In addition to auditing the organization’s development
                        processes, auditors must audit software applications. Areas of
                        particular interest include controls that govern input, processing,
                        and output, as well as the application’s ability to perform
                        calculations correctly and maintain the integrity of data that is
                        being accessed by many users simultaneously.</p>

                    <p class="noindent"><em>Benefits realization</em>, sometimes called
                        <em>business realization</em>, is the result of strategic planning,
                        process development, and systems development, which all contribute
                        toward a launch of business operations to reach a set of business
                        objectives. This chapter focuses on process and systems acquisition
                        and development, which are used to build the engine of business
                        operations. Audits of these activities provide objective views of
                        their effectiveness. Benefits realization is depicted in <a

                    <p class="noindent">A <em>program</em> is an organization of many large,
                        complex activities and can be thought of as <em>a set of projects
                            that work to fulfill one or more key business objectives or
                            goals</em>. A program is generally a multiyear effort that
                        comprises many complex projects, each with its own project manager,
                        project schedule, budget, and participants.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A program is usually run by a <em>program manager</em>
                        who has oversight over all of the projects in the program. <a

                    <p class="indent">Like a single project, a program has a defined scope,
                        budget, resources, and a schedule. A program also helps to organize
                        and coordinate the operation of its projects, identify dependencies
                        between them, manage conflicts and issues, and manage common and
                        shared resources used by project teams.</p>

                        a Program</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">When an organization sets objectives and goals that
                        will be realized through a program, a number of activities usually
                        take place:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Development of a program
                            charter</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <em>charter</em> is a formal
                        document that defines the objectives of a program, its main
                        timelines, the sources of funding, the names of its principal
                        leaders and managers, and the names of the business executive or
                        executives who are sponsoring the program.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Identification of available
                            resources</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior management must
                        identify the resources that will be used by the program. These will
                        include funding, personnel, and business assets such as information
                        systems and other equipment.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The charter and resources provide the direction and
                        the means to begin a program that will move the business closer to
                        realizing its objectives.</p>
                    <div class="sidebar">
                        <h5 class="h5">Titles vs. Roles</h5>
                        <p class="noindent">Many middle and senior managers are program
                            managers, even if they don’t have “program manager” in their
                            title or job description. Any manager who is responsible for the
                            execution of multiple concurrent projects, particularly if those
                            projects are helping the organization get closer to common
                            objectives, is a program manager.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h5 class="h5"><span id="page_164" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>Running
                        a Program</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">After a program has been launched, the program
                        manager needs to manage it actively to ensure that the program is on
                        track and fulfilling its objectives. Some of the activities required
                        may include</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring project
                            schedules</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the projects running
                        in the program will have its own schedule. The program manager will
                        need to examine these schedules periodically to understand how each
                        is progressing. This often requires the program manager to
                        communicate frequently with program participants and project
                        managers to get up-to-date statuses on project tasks.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Managing project
                            budgets</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program manager needs to
                        monitor and manage spending by each of the projects in the program.
                        The program manager may need to make spending adjustments
                        periodically to keep the overall program budget under control.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Managing
                            resources</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program manager needs to
                        understand how resources are being used across all the projects and
                        to make changes as needed. Resources are scarce in most IT
                        organizations, so this requires creativity; often, the program
                        manager needs to <em>find</em> resources before those resources can
                        be used to further program goals.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Identifying and managing
                            conflicts</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual projects will
                        often encounter resource conflicts—sometimes projects will vie for
                        the same resources, or they may require resources in use outside of
                        the program.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Creating program status
                            reports for senior management</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
                        executive sponsors for the program, senior management needs to be
                        kept informed of program status, in whatever level of detail
                        required. Often, these status reports will describe issues and
                        conflicts and how they are being resolved. Sometimes, however,
                        status reports will describe unresolved conflicts that require
                        senior management intervention in the form of resource
                        prioritization to keep vital programs moving ahead.</p>
                    <p class="indent">These activities enable management to measure progress
                        and to adjust resources and priorities to keep the program running
                        smoothly.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Project Portfolio Management</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">The <em>project portfolio</em> is the organization’s
                        entire set of active projects at any given time. Unlike a program,
                        where projects are related and support a common objective, a
                        portfolio of projects is simply <em>all</em> the active projects,
                        which may support many different and even unrelated objectives and
                        be part of different programs.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An organization needs to maintain a collection of
                        information about all its projects in a central location. Having
                        this information will help a senior manager or executive quickly
                        view high-level information about all the active projects in the
                        organization. Often, this information will be stored electronically
                        in a form that will enable an executive <span id="page_165"
                            epub:type="pagebreak"></span>to sort and filter company projects
                        in various ways. Some of the information that may be maintained in

                    <p class="noindent">The prevalent point of view is that IT exists in
                        support of business objectives. Given this assumption, every IT
                        project should directly or indirectly result in tangible business
                        benefits, regardless of how technical or abstract any particular IT
                        project may be.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Before any IT project is permitted to begin, a
                        <em>business case</em> for the project is developed. The purpose of
                        a business case is to explain the benefits to the business that will
                        be realized as a result of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">The development of a business case will normally
                        follow a feasibility study. A <em>feasibility study</em> defines the
                        business problem and describes potential solutions. It is possible,
                        however, that none of the solutions will result in a benefit for the
                        business. For example, each may be too costly or may incur excessive
                        risk. However, the business case should go beyond the feasibility
                        study in terms of business benefits and include actual figures for
                        costs and benefits.</p>

                            self-serving, as the project team may be taking the point of
                            view of justifying the continuation of the project instead of
                            focusing on whether the project will actually benefit the
                            business. The development of a business case should be performed
                            in an objective manner by persons who do not benefit from the
                            result.</p>

                    <p class="indent">The start of a project is not the only time to assess
                        the project’s business case and decide whether to undertake the

                        should be reevaluated. As a project unfolds, often situations
                        develop that could not be anticipated earlier, and these situations
                        sometimes result in added risks, costs, or other changes. For this
                        reason, the business case should be reconsidered throughout the
                        project so that senior management can determine whether the project

                    <p class="noindent">In the mid-to-late 20th century, information
                        technology was primarily used to automate tasks, and in that era it
                        was fairly easy to measure the benefits derived from IT. Often,
                        measuring the benefits was a matter of comparing the cost and time
                        spent to perform tasks manually versus the cost and time spent to
                        automate those tasks. Information technology’s role today is
                        <em>digital transformation</em> (sometimes abbreviated as
                        <em>DX</em> ), which provides benefits that are not so easily
                        measured and are often not short-term in nature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, an organization that invests in a new
                        customer relationship management (CRM) application may do so to
                        improve its customer service in measurable ways. Shortly after
                        implementing a CRM system, productivity may actually decrease until
                        individuals and teams learn how to operate and fully utilize the new
                        system. But customer satisfaction may improve in future quarters. A
                        year or more may be required to determine whether improvements in
                        customer satisfaction is a blip or an actual upward trend
                        attributable to the new CRM. The new system can also help the
                        organization to improve its products and services; the benefits from
                        these improvements may not be experienced for years after
                        implementation of the new CRM.</p>

                        business benefits

                        (KPIs) and measure them formally and accurately over the long term.
                        When new projects and programs are considered, business benefits
                        should be estimated and measurements should be taken before and
                        after the project has completed to validate whether the project’s
                        predictions were valid. The nature of the project may require months
                        or even years of measurements to validate project results.</p>

                    <p class="noindent">The specific objectives of a project must be
                        established and documented before the project begins. In fact,
                        project objectives should be a part of the project’s description
                        when the project is being considered for approval by the IT steering
                        committee. Project objectives should be specific, measurable,
                        achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). They should support
                        and relate to business objectives and to the organization’s key
                        performance indicators.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Example project objectives are</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce customer service call wait
                        time by 70 percent.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce implementation time for new
                        customers by five days.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce annual data storage system
                        cost by 20 percent.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additional objectives that are not a project’s key
                        objectives may also be developed; these objectives may clarify a
                        project’s purpose or the manner in which it will be performed.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Object Breakdown Structure</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">As a part of the project objectives, a project
                        manager may develop an <em>object breakdown structure</em> (OBS),
                        which represents the components of the project in graphical or
                        tabular form. An OBS can help management and project team members
                        better visualize the scope and objectives of the project. An example
                        OBS appears in <a data-savepage-href="ch4.xhtml#ch4fig3"
                            href="https://library/view/cisa-certified-information/9781260458817/ch4.xhtml#ch4fig3">Figure

                        OBS is a visual or structural representation of the system,
                        software, or application, in a hierarchical form, from high level to
                        fine detail. An OBS is not a schematic, architecture, or data flow
                        diagram, although one or more of these may also need to be
                        developed, either as a part of the design or as a tool to help
                        project participants better understand the overall system.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Work Breakdown Structure</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">Another common method for depicting a project is the
                        <em>work breakdown structure</em> (WBS). This is a logical
                        representation of the high-level and detailed tasks that must be
                        performed to complete the project. A WBS used for this purpose can
                        also be used as the basis for the creation of the project schedule.
                        An example WBS is shown in <a data-savepage-href="ch4.xhtml#ch4fig4"
                            href="https://library/view/cisa-certified-information/9781260458817/ch4.xhtml#ch4fig4">Figure

                    <p class="indent">The WBS created in this phase will be simpler than the
                        full-fledged project plan, which will include the resources required
                        to perform each task, task dependencies, and schedules.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In simpler projects, the WBS and the project plan are
                        one and the same. Or, put another way, the WBS can be the
                        <em>start</em> of the project plan, in terms of its containing all
                        the tasks that need to be included in the project plan. With tools
                        like WBS Planner, the WBS is the list of tasks in the left column,
                        and the project plan is that same list when it also contains
                        dependencies, dates, resources, and other details. Project planning
                        is discussed in more detail later in this section.

                    <p class="noindent">Projects should be managed by a project manager. The
                        project manager is responsible for performing several activities:
                    </p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Building and managing the
                            project schedule</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project manager
                        may have developed the original project schedule, and he or she will
                        be responsible for maintaining the schedule throughout the life of
                        the project. As tasks are completed early, on time, or late, this
                        will impact the rest of the project schedule, and the project
                        manager will need to make adjustments to take into account these
                        scheduling variations. In addition to changes in timing, other types
                        of changes in the schedule will be required, including new tasks,
                        new dependencies, and other unforeseen matters that could affect the
                        schedule.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Recording task
                            completion</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tasks progress and are
                        completed, the project manager must keep the project schedule up to
                        date. The project schedule must accurately reflect the status of
                        each task.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Running project
                            meetings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project manager organizes
                        regular meetings of project participants where project status and
                        issues are discussed. The project manager facilitates project
                        meetings to make sure that the meeting agenda is followed. The
                        project manager is also responsible for sending meeting agendas,
                        meeting minutes, and other updates to the project team.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Tracking project
                            expenditures</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project manager is
                        responsible for tracking and reporting on project costs.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Communicating project
                            status</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project manager is
                        responsible for communicating project status to project team members
                        and also to management. A project status report will include details
                        on task statuses and on whether the project is still on schedule and
                        on budget, and a list of open and closed issues.</p>

                            useful, of utmost importance are the project manager’s people
                            skills, which enable the manager to work effectively with
                            project team members and to be an effective facilitator and

                        activities related to the development and management of a project.
                        The project manager is responsible for identifying all the
                        activities required for the project, the sequence in which they must
                        be performed, dependencies between tasks, the resources required,
                        and the priorities of tasks and resources. The project manager will
                        also be expected to determine how the project can make the most
                        efficient use of resources and the shortest amount of time in which
                        the entire project can be completed.</p>

                        planning encompasses many
                        detailed activities:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Task
                            identification</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first steps
                        in the development of a project plan is identifying all the tasks
                        that must be performed to complete the project. This is often
                        accomplished using a project management tool that can be used to
                        build a detailed WBS. When completed, a WBS is a structural
                        decomposition of the work necessary to complete the entire project,
                        task by task, bit by bit.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Task
                            estimation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the project planner
                        has identified all of the tasks required to complete the project,
                        the next step is determining how much time and effort each task
                        requires. There are a couple of different ways to measure this:
                        actual effort and elapsed time. For example, it may take a painter
                        one hour to paint a room, but there is also preparation and cleanup
                        time to consider, and it may take four hours for the paint to dry
                        (though while the paint is drying, the painter can be doing other
                        tasks). Often, it is necessary to know how many hours or days of
                        work are required for one or more persons to perform a task, but
                        knowing elapsed time is critical also.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Task
                            resources</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to know what
                        resources are required to perform a task. Resources include people
                        (and not just any people—often a given task must be performed by
                        specific people), equipment, consumable resources, outside
                        professional services, materials, software licenses, and so on.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Task
                            dependencies</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often in a project there
                        will be tasks that cannot be started until other tasks have been
                        completed. Project managers must discern all of the dependencies
                        between projects so that project teams don’t run into unexpected
                        obstacles.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Milestone
                            tracking</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In larger projects, it is a
                        good idea to identify milestones. Milestones are significant events
                        in the project when major phases have been completed. Example
                        milestones are completion of the design, completion of software
                        development, completion of network wiring, and completion of
                        software testing. Often management will want to schedule a project
                        review meeting when these milestones have been completed; such
                        reviews give management an opportunity to make go/no-go decisions on
                        whether the project should be permitted to continue, or to see
                        whether any lingering issues should first be addressed before the
                        project is continued.</p>

                            tracking</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a project is in
                        progress, the project manager must accurately track the status and
                        progress of every task. He or she also must look toward the
                        short-term and long-term futures, anticipate future resource needs,
                        and make sure that tasks that have not started yet will be able to
                        start without undue delays.</p>

                            the most common pitfalls in project planning is the failure to
                            identify task resources and dependencies properly. Sometimes a
                            project planner will have “optimized” a project plan, only to
                            find out that many tasks that could be done concurrently must be
                            done consecutively. This happens, for instance, when several
                            tasks that are slated to be done in parallel must all be
                            performed by the same individual. For example, five tasks that
                            take one day each were scheduled to all take place on the same
                            day, but it turns out that the same person is required to
                            perform all of those tasks; this results in those tasks being
                            completed one day after another, requiring five days in all.</p>

                    <p class="noindent">Several tools and methods can be used to estimate
                        the amount of effort required to complete tasks in a software
                        project. Tools and methodologies can make the task of estimating
                        work more accurate, because they rely on techniques that have been
                        proven over the long run. Also, tools and methodologies can reduce
                        the time required to perform the estimating work.</p>
                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>Using the OBS</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                        OBS can be useful to depict the system and its components visually,
                        particularly in complex projects where the tasks, costs, and other
                        aspects of the project are not immediately evident. Object breakdown
                        structures are described in more detail earlier in this chapter.</p>
                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>Using the WBS</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                        WBS is a great way to get to the tasks in a complex project. A
                        project manager or planner can decompose large efforts into smaller
                        and smaller pieces, down to the task level.</p>
                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>Using Source Lines of
                            Code</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sizing for software projects has
                        traditionally relied upon <em>source lines of code</em> (SLOC)
                        estimates. Experienced systems analysts could make rough estimates
                        on the numbers of lines of code required for a given software
                        project. Then, using results from past projects, the analyst could
                        make an accurate estimate for the time required to develop a program
                        based on its length. A similar measuring unit is kilo lines of code
                        (KLOC).</p>
                    <p class="indent">SLOC and KLOC offer the advantages of being
                        quantitative and somewhat repeatable for a given computer language
                        such as COBOL, FORTRAN, or BASIC. However, these methods are falling
                        out of favor because many of the languages in use today are not
                        textual in nature.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The most direct replacement for SLOC/KLOC are methods
                        that estimate the effort required to program a form, page, window,
                        report, cell, widget, file, or calculation. For example, the
                        programming effort for a web application would be tied to the number
                        of forms, pages, and windows in a web application and the number of
                        fields and variables in each.</p>

                        analogy between the older and newer methods for estimating source

                        drawings for an automobile. Old methods would rely on the weight
                        (number of pounds, akin to the number of lines of code) of the car.
                        Newer methods rely on the number of individual features (engine
                        size, number of doors, seats, lights, accessories, and so on).</p>

                        lines of code), so it is more adaptable for today’s graphical user
                        interface (GUI)–based software.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In FPA, the analyst studies the detailed design
                        specifications for an application program and counts the number of
                        user inputs, user outputs, user queries, files, and external
                        interfaces. The analyst then selects a complexity weighting factor
                        for each of those five points. The number of inputs, outputs,
                        queries, files, and interfaces are multiplied by their respective
                        complexity weights, and those products are added together. The sum
                        is called the number of unadjusted <em>function points</em> (FPs)
                        for the program.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A <em>value adjustment factor</em> (VAF) is then
                        determined for the application; this factor will raise or lower the
                        function points based upon 14 criteria that address various aspects
                        of application complexity. The total number of unadjusted function
                        points is multiplied by the VAF to yield the total adjusted function
                        points.</p>

                    <p class="noindent">When the project manager or planner has established
                        the complete breakdown of tasks and has determined resources,
                        dependencies, and levels of effort for each, he or she can create
                        the actual project schedule. Tools such as Trac, Microsoft Planner,
                        Microsoft Project, and many others will automatically assign dates
                        to tasks once their duration, dependencies, and resources are
                        identified.</p>
                    <p class="indent">After the planner/manager has entered all of the tasks
                        into a project planning tool, he or she will probably discover that
                        the end date of the project (as calculated by the tool) is long
                        after the date that senior management has defined as the end of the
                        project.</p>

                        each task and see whether those estimates were high. A good project
                        manager presses for details as he or she asks the expert to justify

                        network, it is possible to draw “paths” through ordered tasks from

                    <p class="indent">A project’s <em>critical path</em> is that path

                            id="page_181" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>It is important to
                        identify the critical path in a project, because this enables the
                        project manager to understand which tasks are most likely to impact
                        the project schedule and to determine when the project will finally
                        conclude. When a project manager knows which tasks are on the
                        critical path, he or she can perform analysis and attempt to improve
                        the project plan through one of the following:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Start critical tasks
                            earlier</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a critical-path task on a
                        project can be started earlier, this will directly affect the
                        project’s end date. To be able to start a task earlier, it may be
                        necessary to change the way that earlier dependent tasks are
                        performed. For example, a Unix system administrator can be brought
                        into a project a week earlier to begin critical tasks such as
                        building servers.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Reduce
                            dependencies</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If earlier tasks in the
                        project can be changed, it may be possible to remove one or more
                        dependencies that will enable critical tasks to begin (and hence,
                        end) earlier. For example, the “Install operating system” task
                        depends on an earlier task, “Purchase server.” If the organization
                        has an available server in-house, the project does not need to wait
                        to order, purchase, and receive a server. By using an in-house
                        server, the “Install operating system” task can be started earlier.
                    </p>

                            critical tasks</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some labor-intensive
                        tasks can be completed more quickly if more resources are available
                        to assist with them. An experienced project manager will be able to
                        identify the types of tasks that can be shortened by adding
                        resources. As the saying goes, however, “Nine women cannot make a
                        baby in one month.” Experienced project managers are keenly aware of
                        the concept behind this truth.</p>

                            critical-path analysis to find opportunities to shorten the
                            project schedule. This can also help to smooth out resource

                            a project’s schedule, often by a significant proportion.</p>

                            seeking opportunities to compress the schedule by removing
                            dependencies. They achieve this by becoming familiar with the
                            details of every task and by asking tough questions of the

                        and valleys of resource utilization are costly and disruptive.
                        They’re more costly especially when external resources (for example,
                        contractors and consultants) are used, since on-again, off-again
                        resource utilization may incur extra fees. But they can also be
                        costly for internal resources if personnel are being shuttled back
                        and forth between projects. Starts and stops can mean that personnel
                        incur startup time as they move back and forth between projects.</p>

                            Management</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many projects, time is
                        the primary constraint, and in such projects, the end date is
                        non-negotiable. A <em>timebox</em> is a period in which a project
                        (or a set of tasks within a project) must be completed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Timeboxing can increase the chances that a large
                        project can be completed within a certain time period by splitting
                        it into several periods (each usually a few weeks long). Each
                        timebox has its own budget, which is fixed. The deliverable for each
                        timebox, however, can be adjusted somewhat, provided that the
                        customer (or primary end user) agrees with any changes.</p>

                            timelines slip. One characteristic of software developers is a
                            tendency to strive for perfection on a project. The result of
                            this tendency is that developers will complete a task and then
                            repeatedly “preen” the output, which takes considerable extra

                    <p class="noindent">When a project is launched, company management has
                        agreed to sponsor and allocate resources to the project based upon
                        the objectives of the project at its onset. As a project is launched
                        and as it progresses week by week, the project manager and team will
                        meet regularly to discuss the schedule and any issues that arise
                        that were unanticipated at the start of the project.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While managing the project schedule, a project manager
                        could be tempted to adjust the end date on a task that is running
                        late to adjust affected downstream tasks. However, doing so may
                        affect the budget or the final project deliverable. Management might
                        not appreciate the project manager making arbitrary changes to the
                        project schedule without asking for permission. If management
                        permits this degree of latitude from the project manager, it is
                        likely that the schedule will continue to slip here and there,
                        significantly affecting the final completion date as well as the
                        budget and resource utilization. This type of change cannot be
                        permitted to take place.</p>

                        that affect the overall
                        project schedule, deliverables, resources, and budget need to be
                        formally identified and submitted for approval through a formal
                        change process. Management needs to establish parameters for changes
                        to budget, schedule, deliverables, and resources. For example, any
                        proposed project change that results in a change of budget or final
                        delivery date would need to be approved by management. The procedure
                        for making changes to the project should be done in two basic steps:
                    </p>
                    <p class="listt"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project team,
                        together with the project manager, should identify the specific
                        issue, its impact on the project, and their proposed remedy. This
                        information should be packaged into a formal request.</p>
                    <p class="listb"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change
                        request should be presented to management, either in one of the
                        regular project meetings or in a separate meeting that includes the
                        project manager, any relevant project team members (experts in the
                        specific matter to be discussed), and members of senior
                        management—preferably those who are sponsoring the project. The
                        proposed change and its impact on the project should be discussed,
                        and management should make a decision on whether to approve the
                        change.</p>
                    <p class="indent">It should be evident that not every small change needs
                        to go through this process. A spending increase of $10 is hardly a
                        reason to call a management review, but an increase of $50,000 done
                        without any review may make management fuming mad. Management needs
                        to set some parameters so that change reviews will take place only
                        when changes exceed any set thresholds.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Smaller changes in schedule and budget can be made a
                        part of a regular project status report that should be sent to
                        management and project sponsors. Smaller issues of changes to
                        budget, schedule, and resources can be highlighted so that
                        management is aware of these less significant changes.</p>

                        <em>stakeholders</em> and <em>employees.</em> The stakeholders are
                        the ScrumMaster, product owner, and team members. The employees are
                        everyone else on the team; though they are interested in the outcome
                        of the project, their jobs are probably not on the line.

                        typical Scrum team is just five to nine members. Larger projects are

                        hundreds of programmers.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A typical Scrum project consists of a <em>sprint</em>,
                        a focused effort to produce some portion of the total project
                        deliverable. A sprint usually lasts from two to four weeks.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The project team meets every day in a meeting called
                        the <em>daily standup</em> (or the <em>Daily Scrum</em>) that lasts
                        no more than 15 minutes. It is called a <em>standup</em> because
                        participants usually stand (it helps the meeting go faster). The
                        ScrumMaster leads the meeting and asks three questions of each team
                        member:</p>
                    <p class="listt"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have you done

                        standup, only stakeholders are permitted to speak.</p>
                    <p class="indent">At the end of each sprint, a <em>sprint
                            retrospective</em> is held, a meeting that is a reflection of

                    <h5 class="h5">Lean</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">You should think of <em>lean</em> more as an
                        approach than as a process like waterfall or Scrum. Lean focuses on
                        efficiency; it starts by identifying value and then achieves it
                        through the mindset of continuous improvement and elimination of
                        waste.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Lean was derived from the <em>lean manufacturing</em>
                        methodology that originated in the Japanese manufacture of Toyota
                        automobiles, which focused on the elimination of waste without
                        sacrificing value.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The principles of lean are</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminate waste.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amplify learning.</p>

                    <h5 class="h5">Agile</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">Like lean, <em>agile</em> is more of an approach
                        than a methodology or a process. The agile manifesto describes four
                        principles:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals and interactions over
                        processes and tools</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working software over comprehensive
                        documentation</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer collaboration over contract
                        negotiation</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to change over following
                        a plan</p>
                    <p class="indent">Agile is mainly known as an iterative technique used
                        to move a project toward success. Pundits would call agile a
                        development process without a master plan, but with iterative plans
                        instead. Like an artist rendering a painting, the artist adds basic
                        shapes and hues, continually adding detail and touching up until the
                        piece is finished.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Kanban</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">Also derived from the lean Toyota Production System
                        manufacturing model, the root of Kanban is the visual Kanban board
                        that shows the overall flow and progress of a project. <a

                            4-9</a> shows an example Kanban board. Arguably, the greatest
                        strength of Kanban is its visual display of planned tasks, work in
                        progress, and completed tasks. While managing a project, a project
                        manager will pull forward specific tasks as resources are available
                        to complete them.</p>

                    </h5>
                    <p class="noindent">As the name suggests, <em>Scrumban</em> is a
                        combination of Scrum and Kanban methodologies. Scrumban has the
                        structure of Scrum with the flexibility of Kanban. Scrumban is
                        suitable for Kanban-oriented teams that need more structure, or for
                        Scrum teams that need more flexibility.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="noindent">Developing and maintaining information systems is a
                        complex undertaking that requires a great deal of structure,
                        organization, and discipline. Application software and other systems
                        are used to automate or support key business processes.
                        Organizations rely heavily on applications to be operating properly,
                        on demand, and with sufficient capacity.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Designing, developing, and using information systems
                        requires a diverse array of skills that are typically held by people
                        located throughout an organization. These diverse skills are applied
                        by persons with different levels and styles of education, and in the
                        workplace, these different groups of people are sometimes suspicious
                        of one another and believe that the others do not really understand
                        “the way things ought to be.” This is a part of the human dynamic
                        that affects the performance of project teams and influences the
                        outcome of larger development projects.</p>
                    <p class="indent">System development projects are expensive. Given the
                        cost of developers, project managers, software tools, and computer
                        hardware, even a “small” project can easily cost many tens of
                        thousands of dollars, and large projects can cost several million.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Management wants the project to finish on time and on
                        budget, and users want the software to operate as promised.
                        Shareholders want the entire development process to be efficient and
                        effective.</p>

                            (BPLC), covered later in this chapter. Familiarity with the

                    <p class="indent">These factors are among those that demand that the

                        that all activities are performed according to a plan. The SDLC is a
                        framework for deciding what software should do, building it

                        <p class="noindent">IT and security professionals who have been in
                            the business for more than ten years will sooner or later notice
                            the switch in the well-known SDLC acronym. Originally, and for
                            decades, SDLC referred to the “software development life cycle,”
                            for many organizations developed their own business applications
                            and spent considerable effort maintaining and customizing those
                            applications over many years.</p>
                        <p class="indent">Two changes have occurred. First, fewer
                            organizations develop their own business application software,
                            and instead purchase off-the-shelf applications or (more often)
                            subscribe to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) services for their
                            primary business applications. Second, the SDLC life cycle has
                            been expanded to encompass projects such as the development of
                            infrastructure. Hence, the “S” in SDLC has been changed to
                            “systems” to represent a broader perspective than just that of
                            software applications.</p>

                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev120">SDLC Phases</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">The <em>systems development life cycle</em>
                        describes the end-to-end process for developing and maintaining
                        software. A common structure for SDLC is a <em>waterfall</em>-style
                        framework that consists of several distinct phases:</p>
                    <p class="listt"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feasibility study
                    </p>

                    <p class="list"><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development</p>

                    <p class="list"><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation</p>
                    <p class="listb">
                        <strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-implementation
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Organizations often employ a “gate process” approach
                        to their SDLC by requiring that a formal review be held at the
                        conclusion of each phase before the next phase is permitted to
                        begin. The review is usually a formal meeting where project managers
                        and other participants describe the status of the project;
                        management, if satisfied that the current phase of the project has
                        been completed successfully and that all requirements have been met,
                        will permit the project to proceed to the next phase.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In addition to the waterfall SDLC model, iterative and
                        spiral models are used in SDLC processes. The iterative and spiral
                        models both operate in (visually) circular modes, as opposed to the
                        linear waterfall model.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><span id="page_194" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The
                        <em>spiral</em> model consists of the development of requirements,
                        design, and one or more prototypes, followed by additional
                        requirements and design phases until the entire design is complete.
                        Similarly, the development in the <em>iterative</em> model goes
                        through one or more loops of planning, requirements, design, coding,
                        and testing until development and implementation are considered
                        complete.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="noindent">The first phase of the SDLC is the <em>feasibility
                            study</em>. But how does the feasibility study get started? It
                        does not create itself; instead, the feasibility study is started as
                        a result of some pre-SDLC event.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An instantiation of the SDLC is created when
                        management has decided that some new software application is needed
                        or some significant changes are needed in an existing application.
                        By “instantiation” I mean that management has decided to initiate
                        the process to develop or update a software application. Management
                        makes such a decision as a response to an event, which could be any
                        of the following:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Changes in market
                            conditions</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the entrance
                        of a new competitor or the development of a new product or service
                        feature by a competitor may spur management to respond by matching
                        the competitor’s capabilities. A competitor can also create a new
                        market through innovation in products or services; this kind of a
                        move sometimes needs to be answered by making a change to maintain
                        parity with the competitor. Or <em>your</em> organization may be the
                        one that creates a new market through some groundbreaking innovation
                        in the way that it does business or in what it delivers to its
                        customers.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Changes in costs or
                            expenses</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dramatic shifts in capital or
                        expense costs may force an organization to make changes. For
                        instance, higher fuel costs may prompt the organization to reduce
                        field service calls, but doing so might require better remote
                        diagnostic and self-healing capabilities. In the 1990s, the shift to
                        software development outsourcing required transformations in
                        development methodologies that prompted organizations to make or buy
                        better defect-management applications. And dropping
                        telecommunications costs and higher bandwidth meant that online
                        service providers began to ratchet up their offerings, most of which
                        required enhancements to existing online service applications, and
                        sometimes brand-new ones.</p>

                            regulation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise in dependence on
                        technology has resulted in some negative events, which in turn
                        resulted in new legislation or changes in existing legislation.
                        Examples of relatively recent and updated regulation include
                        Sarbanes-Oxley; GLBA (Gramm Leach Bliley Act); HIPAA (Health
                        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act); <span id="page_195"
                            epub:type="pagebreak"></span>FERC/NERC (regulations from the
                        Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric

                        America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and

                        DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard); and many others.
                        Many of these regulations require organizations to implement
                        additional safeguards, controls, and recordkeeping to information
                        systems. Sometimes this results in an organization opting to
                        discontinue use of an older information system in favor of making or
                        buying a newer application that can more effectively comply with
                        applicable laws.</p>

                            risk</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New types of vulnerabilities are
                        discovered with regularity, and new threats are developed in
                        response to vulnerabilities as well as changes in economic
                        conditions and organizational business models. In other words,
                        hackers find new ways to try and attack systems for profit within
                        the growing cyber-criminal enterprises of the world. Applications
                        that were considered safe just a few years ago are now known to be
                        too vulnerable to operate. Reducing risk sometimes means making
                        changes to application logic, and sometimes it requires that an
                        application be discontinued altogether.</p>

                            processes</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many types of changes to
                        business processes will require organizations to alter their
                        business applications so that they continue to support those
                        processes. For example, a change in the way that purchase orders are
                        requested and approved may require changes to the financial
                        accounting application.</p>

                        agreements between organizations can compel an organization to make
                        changes to its software applications. There are several possible
                        reasons for this, including changes in risks or regulations imposed
                        upon customer or partner organizations.</p>

                        discussed will often prompt customer organizations to ask for new
                        features or for changes in existing features in the products and
                        services they buy. Often this requires changes in processes and
                        applications to meet these customers’ needs.</p>
                    <p class="indent">It is important to understand that <em>innovation</em>
                        is also a valid and frequent reason that an organization chooses to
                        make changes to a software application. Generally, this means that
                        an organization has developed new features or methods in a software
                        application in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage.</p>

                            turns to more formal actions and, finally, to the initiation of

                        Study</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">The <em>feasibility study</em> is the first formal
                        phase in the SDLC. The feasibility study is an intellectual effort
                        that seeks to determine whether a specific change or set of changes
                        in business processes and underlying applications is practical to
                        undertake.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Capital and money are the fuel and lubricant for an
                        organization. Often the purpose of a feasibility study is not to
                        answer the question, “Can a specific type of change be made to the
                        business?” but rather, “Is a specific type of change to the business
                        feasible from a cost and benefit perspective?” In other words, the
                        feasibility study is an analysis of proposed changes to business
                        processes and supporting applications, including the costs
                        associated with making those changes and the benefits that are
                        expected as a result of those changes. While there is often a
                        qualitative aspect in the feasibility study, there is almost always
                        a quantitative aspect that states, “These specific changes will cost
                        XXX to build, YYY to maintain, and are anticipated to make a ZZZ
                        impact on revenue.”</p>
                    <p class="indent">Organizations don’t always make changes to business
                        processes to increase revenue or reduce costs. However, revenue and
                        costs are nearly always the quantitative elements that receive
                        attention. For example, if an organization is enacting changes to
                        processes and systems to remain compliant with regulations,
                        management is still going to be interested in the cost and revenue
                        impact that the changes will bring about.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A feasibility study often will propose two or more
                        approaches to a particular challenge. For instance, if a project has
                        been initiated as a result of changes in market conditions, the
                        purpose of the feasibility study may be to explore various ways to
                        respond to those market conditions; for each way to respond, there
                        may be two, three, or more ways to implement the change by using a
                        variety of technologies or approaches. For example, when a
                        ride-sharing service seeks ways of expanding its markets, it
                        considers developing additional services such as the delivery of
                        restaurant meals, flowers, and other goods.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The feasibility study should also include the
                        following considerations:</p>

                        between the new system and other existing systems</p>

                        have the appearance and form of impartiality and should not reflect

                        that the preceding examples
                        do not specify <em>how</em> the application is to accomplish these
                        things. Business requirements are interested in <em>what</em> the
                        application does; the application architect or designer will
                        determine <em>how</em> the application will support those
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In a few circumstances, new business requirements are
                        not needed for a software modification. For example, if a software
                        interface is being upgraded, an existing software program may need
                        to be modified to work with the new interface. A change like this
                        should be transparent to users, and the software should not differ
                        in the way that it supports existing business requirements. So, in a
                        way, it can be argued that business requirements apply even in this
                        case: the program will still be required to adhere to existing
                        business functional requirements.</p>

                        broad category includes many specific requirements related to the
                        manner in which application users authenticate onto the system. For
                        systems that perform autonomous authentication, this will include
                        all of the password quality requirements (minimum length,

                        password reset procedures, user account provisioning, and user ID
                        standards. Authentication standards may also include requirements
                        for machine and system accounts in support of automated functions in
                        the application. For applications that use a network-based
                        authentication service such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
                        Protocol), Kerberos, or a single-sign-on (SSO) solution, security

                        in the application. Authorization requirements may include the way
                        in which roles are established, maintained, and audited. An
                        organization may require that the application support a number of
                        <em>roles</em>, which are templates that contain authorization
                        details that can be applied to a user account.

                        how the application is configured to permit access to users and/or
                        roles. Unlike authorization, which is about assigning roles to
                        users, access control is concerned with assigning access permissions
                        to objects such as application functions and data. Depending upon
                        the way in which an application is designed, permissions assignment

                        contexts and yet must still be protected from those who do not have
                        authorization to access it. Encryption standards fall into two broad
                        categories: (1) data requiring encryption in certain settings and
                        contexts, and with certain encryption algorithms and key lengths;
                        and (2) key management to be handled in specific ways that permit

                        Instead, an application should perform validation checks against
                        input data, whether a user types in input data on an application
                        input form or the application receives the data via a batch feed

                        but also the results of intermediate calculations and output data.
                        Requirements should also specify what the application should do when

                        on a cold recovery server without complicated, expensive, or
                        time-consuming software licensing issues. Requirements could also
                        dictate the ability for the application to be easily recovered from
                        a server or virtual machine image on a storage area network (SAN),
                        to operate correctly in a virtual server environment, and to operate
                        correctly in a cloud environment such as AWS or Azure. An
                        application might also be expected to work with a different brand or
                        version of the database management system or to coexist with other
                        applications, even though it may usually be configured to run on a
                        server by itself.</p>
                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>Privacy
                            Requirements</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broadest sense,
                        privacy is about two distinctly different issues. First, privacy has
                        to do with the protection of personally sensitive information so
                        that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties. This aspect of
                        privacy neatly falls into the umbrella of security: security
                        requirements can be developed that require access controls or
                        encryption of personal information.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The other aspect of privacy is the prevention of
                        proliferation and misuse of personally sensitive information. This
                        has a lot less to do with security and more to do with how the
                        organization treats and uses sensitive information and whether it
                        permits this information to be passed on to other organizations for
                        their own purposes. In this regard, privacy is <span id="page_202"
                            epub:type="pagebreak"></span>about business functionality that
                        is specifically related to how the application handles personal
                        information.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, if an application includes canned reports
                        about customers, and those reports are sent to third parties, those
                        reports should be configurable so that they can contain (or omit)
                        certain fields. For instance, customers’ date of birth may be
                        omitted from a report that is sent to a third-party organization to
                        reduce the possibility of the third party using or abusing
                        information to the detriment of individual customers. The rule in
                        this case is this: “You can’t abuse or misuse information you do not
                        possess or cannot access.” Indeed, regulations such as the European
                        GDPR require that organizations collect sensitive data only as
                        required to perform services, and that they retain the data for only
                        as long as it is needed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Increasingly, privacy is addressed by regulation, so
                        an organization may choose to classify privacy requirements in a
                        privacy section or in a regulations section.</p>
                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>Organizing and Reviewing
                            Requirements</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a software project in
                        which many individuals are contributing requirements, the project
                        manager or another person should track each requirement back to a
                        specific individual so that person can justify or explain those
                        requirements if needed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When all requirements have been collected and
                        categorized, the project manager should check with each contributor
                        to make sure that each requirement is actually a
                        <em>requirement</em> and not merely a “nice-to-have” feature.
                        Perhaps each requirement can be weighted or ranked in order of
                        importance. This will help, especially in a request for proposals
                        (RFP) situation, where analysts need to evaluate suppliers’
                        conformance to individual requirements. This helps project personnel
                        determine which vendors are best able to meet the requirements that
                        matter most.

                            are measurable. The reason for this is that the requirements
                            developed in this phase of the project should flow directly into
                            user acceptance testing plans (for functional requirements) and

                            Process</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of
                        mainstream business functions, such as accounting, customer
                        relationship management, incident management, sales force
                        management, and enterprise resource planning, can be handled
                        exceedingly well using cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and
                        common off-the-shelf (COTS) software. Advances in SaaS and COTS
                        software have resulted in most IT organizations needing to develop
                        only custom interfaces between SaaS or COTS applications and
                        specialized programs that cannot be readily obtained. Thus, the SDLC
                        process can be morphed somewhat to accommodate the fact that most
                        big software projects are a matter of leasing or buying, not making.
                        The result is the ever popular RFP activity used to communicate
                        requirements and solicit proposals from vendors. Typical steps in
                        the RFP process are</p>

                        applications and solutions so that they can develop better
                        requirements that will more closely align with business needs.</p>

                        trend makes the development of good requirements much more
                        important, because the matching of different vendors’ software
                        products with business and technical requirements depends mostly on
                        requirements. The software that is obtained is configurable only to
                        a point, and it probably will not be able to perform other functions
                        so easily. In an environment where a business analyst or project
                        manager realizes that some requirements were omitted, if the
                        organization wrote its own software, then it might be fairly easy to
                        change the application. If, on the other hand, some important
                        requirements were omitted and a product selection was made in the
                        absence of those requirements, the organization may have to live
                        without the functionality related to those requirements. It’s kind
                        of like specifying a four-passenger automobile because you forgot
                        about that fifth family member; now that you’ve got the car, it’s
                        more difficult to make a change.</p>

                            stability</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an organization is
                        considering purchasing or licensing software from a software vendor,
                        the organization should examine the financial stability of the
                        vendor. This is done as a way of determining whether the vendor is
                        likely to be in business in the future. If the vendor’s financial
                        fundamentals are unhealthy, then purchasing software from this
                        vendor is a risky proposition, since the vendor may not be in
                        business in the future. This would probably require the organization
                        to change its software in another expensive application migration
                        that could have been avoided.</p>

                            roadmap</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the software vendor
                        may be healthy, it’s also important to understand the vendor’s
                        long-term vision for its product. This includes not only business
                        functionality but also the technical platforms that will be
                        supported in the future. In this regard, it is also useful to know
                        whether any of the vendors being considered can be deemed to be
                        market leaders or market followers. If the organization shopping for
                        software is likewise a market leader, it may make more sense to
                        select a market-leading company that will be able to keep up with
                        the organization’s own vision and market leadership.</p>

                        important to understand how much experience a prospective vendor
                        has. A suitable vendor should have many years of experience
                        developing software for the solution that the organization is trying
                        to solve. This will help to clarify whether the vendor has been in
                        the business of developing this particular type of software for a
                        long time or has only recently entered the market. Deep experience
                        will give confidence that the vendor has experience helping its
                        customers solve the types of business problems that its software is
                        designed to solve, whereas a company with little experience will
                        probably have more difficulty helping its customers solve even
                        simpler business problems, not to mention unusual or complex
                        problems. You do not want to be in the position of calling the
                        software vendor to ask, “Hi, we have a new kind of problem that we
                        need to solve,” only to receive the answer, “Well, we won’t be able
                        to be of much help because we’re new at this ourselves.”</p>

                        for a software product as mundane as one for accounting, it is
                        important to know each vendor’s vision for how it aims to innovate
                        and to approach business problems in the future. If a vendor’s
                        vision varies widely from your organization’s vision, perhaps that
                        particular vendor is not the best choice. Although difference in
                        vision should rarely disqualify a vendor entirely, it should be just
                        one more variable to consider in the long equation of vendor
                        selection.</p>

                        strict controls so that users in one customer organization are not
                        able to access other customers’ data, even in cases of software

                        with at least two or three reference customers. I suggest that a
                        standard questionnaire be developed before any vendor contacts are
                        made. A questionnaire will help the project manager or business
                        analyst to collect the same information from each reference
                        customer. This will help the organization more easily compare
                        reference information that has been collected from several reference
                        clients. Questions asked of reference clients fall into several

                        about the quality of this effort. Find out what kinds of specific
                        issues came up and how the vendor managed them.</p>

                        going to be assisting with migrating business functionality to the
                        new software application, ask each reference client about the
                        quality of this effort. Whether it went well or not so well, get the
                        names of specific personnel so that your organization can (if
                        feasible) ask that certain vendor staff be there to support

                        rank in terms of requirements and references. If you can reduce the
                        field of potential vendors to the top two or three vendors, you may
                        choose to evaluate their products in your IT environment for a time.
                        This means installing the software in your organization to try out
                        with some users. The evaluation should be highly scripted—not to
                        “win” or “lose,” but to verify systematically that the software
                        performs as claimed and that the vendor’s responses to your
                        functional requirements are credible. If the software operates
                        differently from their claims in the RFP responses, it’s time either
                        to ask hard questions or to disqualify the vendor for stretching the
                        truth and move on.</p>

                            support</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success with a given vendor’s
                        software product can rest on vendor support alone. Specifically, if
                        there are problems and support is of insufficient quality, the
                        project can stall or even fail. Support quality has a few dimensions
                        to it, including timeliness, quality, and speed to escalation. If a
                        vendor falls short in any of these areas, then that choice may have
                        more risk.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Source code
                            escrow</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an organization develops
                        its own software, of course the software is already in the
                        organization’s custody. However, when a third-party vendor develops
                        the software, the customer probably does not have a copy of it.
                        Under ordinary business conditions, this is acceptable. However,
                        should the vendor fail, the vendor will be unable to maintain the
                        software and the organization would be stuck with a software package
                        without source code or programmers to support it. Source code escrow
                        is a viable solution to this problem, and it works like this: The
                        software vendor sends an electronic copy of its source code to a
                        third-party software escrow firm, which keeps control of the
                        software. If, however, the software vendor goes out of business, the
                        organization will be able to obtain a copy of the vendor’s software
                        for support purposes. This is a bad-case scenario, but it’s better
                        than the worst-case scenario, where the software vendor goes out of
                        business and the organization has no source code at all.</p>

                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Selection</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
                        the organization has narrowed the search down to two or three
                        vendors, it’s time to do more critical thinking, discussing, and
                        identifying of the primary strengths, weaknesses, and
                        differentiators between the vendor finalists. The RFP team should
                        make a recommendation to management on its choice, explaining why
                        this particular vendor should be chosen over the others. The final
                        decision on a software vendor should be made by management, with the
                        RFP team being a consultative body. Remember that senior management
                        will be making a business decision that partly considers the
                        technology and partly considers the value proposition (the value
                        derived from a given expenditure).</p>

                        made, the contract between the organization and the software vendor
                        needs to be negotiated. There are plenty of ways that the software
                        vendor can be held accountable in terms of delivering and supporting
                        software that meets the business’s needs. However, the organization
                        purchasing the software will also likely have obligations of its
                        own. I recommend that you <em>not</em> tell the other vendor
                        finalists that they are out of the game too soon. If contract
                        negotiations with the first-choice vendor do not proceed well, it
                        may be smart to begin negotiations with one of the other finalists
                        (management should decide which vendor). Contract negotiation should
                        be left to the lawyers. However, lawyers on each side will often
                        consult with IT experts or management to make sure that sections of
                        contract language accurately describe systems, controls, security,
                        and any other matters that lawyers may not have expertise in.</p>

                        (RFI) is similar to a request for proposal (RFP) in that
                        organizations are soliciting information from one or more vendors or
                        service providers. Compared to an RFP, an RFI is lightweight, as it
                        requests information about vendors’ products and services with no
                        stated intent to purchase any services or products.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An RFI might precede a planned purchase, or it could
                        precede an RFP. Mainly, the purpose of an RFI is to help individuals
                        in an organization learn more about specific vendors or the products
                        or services they sell.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Design</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">When all functional, technology, security, privacy,
                        regulatory, and other requirements have been finalized, design of
                        the application can begin. It is assumed that a high-level design
                        was developed in the feasibility study, since an elementary design
                        is necessary to estimate costs to compute the financial viability of
                        the application—but, if not, the high-level design should be
                        developed first.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The design effort should be a top-down process,
                        starting with the major components of the application and then
                        decomposing each module into increasingly detailed pieces.</p>
                    <p class="indent">It’s difficult to say whether a data flow diagram
                        (DFD), entity relationship diagram (ERD), or some other high-level
                        depiction of the application should be developed first. This will
                        depend partly upon the nature of the application and partly on the
                        experience of the developers, analysts, and designers. Regardless,
                        design should start at a high level and graduate to levels of
                        increasing complexity, to the point where database designers and
                        developers have sufficient detail to begin development.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Project team members who represent business
                        owners/operators/customers should review the application design to
                        confirm that the analysts’ and designers’ concept of the application
                        agrees with that of the business owners. Reviews should be done at
                        each level <span id="page_207" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>of
                        design, not just at the top level. Business experts should be able
                        to read and understand both a high-level design and a detailed
                        design and to confirm whether the design is appropriate or not.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Design review by customers can be a step in the
                        process where business customers and designers do not see eye-to-eye
                        and where they might disagree on the design; any disagreements can
                        be attributed either to differences in the understanding of
                        technology or to practical versus abstract thinking. To end the
                        design review prematurely could have costly consequences. The
                        potential consequences of failing to come to an agreement on design

                        development of test plans that will be used during the development
                        and test phases of the project. Test plans need to be developed no
                        later than the design phase, because developers will need to perform
                        <span id="page_208" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>unit testing during
                        development as a way of verifying that they have coded software
                        modules properly (and they may need to consult test plan documents
                        for confirmation that they are developing software correctly). If
                        test plans are not developed until the test phase, developers will
                        have to figure out tests on their own, or they might not perform
                        enough testing, which will result in many more defects being
                        discovered during the formal testing phase of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">When design reviews have concluded that the design is
                        complete, a “design freeze” should be instituted, whereby no further
                        changes to any level of design will be permitted. With a design
                        freeze in effect, both designers and users are more inclined to
                        really think through all of the details of the design and do a
                        better job of confirming whether the design is correct.</p>
                    <p class="indent">An organization that does not institute a design
                        freeze will find the design changing throughout the development
                        phase, which will result in different parts of the application
                        conforming to different “versions” of the ever-changing design. This
                        will result in chaos during the development and testing phases and
                        is sure to result in many more reported defects during user
                        acceptance testing and after implementation. Management should
                        strongly assert a design freeze, since changing the design during
                        the development phase will drive up development costs when
                        developers are forced to rework code that was written in conformance
                        to earlier versions of the design.</p>

                        that will be used to write the application. Rarely does an
                        organization have a wide-open choice of languages; rather, its
                        choices will be constrained by several factors, including</p>

                        organization’s preferences for specific brands of computer hardware,
                        operating systems, and databases will limit available languages to
                        those that are available on its chosen application platform.</p>

                        limited by available programming experience among staff or
                        contracted developers. After the application has been developed and
                        placed in use, the organization will need to make periodic changes;
                        an experienced developer will be needed for that task as well.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">

                        a given hardware and software environment, the nature of the
                        application will make some of the available languages more desirable
                        and others less so. For instance, an organization wants to write a
                        professional-services invoicing application in a Unix environment
                        where assembler, C, C++, C#, and Java are the available languages.
                        Chances are good that assembler will be eliminated, because
                        assembler is a poor choice for application development. Instead,
                        C++, C#, or Java is likely to be chosen. Similarly, mobile
                        applications on the Android platform are likely to be written in
                        Java, and applications for iOS are likely to be written in Swift.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Another factor that will influence language selection
                        is the availability of development and testing tools. With nearly as
                        much scrutiny as for the application features themselves, the
                        organization should carefully select an application development
                        environment if it does not already have one (or if it has determined
                        that its present capabilities are insufficient).</p>
                    <p class="indent">Requirements for a development environment must
                        include functions that will permit developers to write software code
                        that can meet functional requirements for the application itself.
                        If, for example, functional requirements specify a high degree of
                        accuracy in a way that requires a high volume of test cases, a
                        development environment that can help to automate testing will
                        enable developers to perform this rigorous testing more easily.</p>

                        provide data to other systems. Sometimes “bridge programs” or
                        integration gateways need to be written that serve to move and

                        organizations often desire that new applications use a system- or
                        network-based authentication service. The primary advantage to this
                        approach is that users do not need to remember yet another user ID
                        and password. An application’s authentication can often be tied to
                        LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory, or it can be part of a federated

                        developer may be needed to develop these reports. Even if a report

                        properly and is free of defects. The testing that a developer
                        performs is called <em>unit testing</em>; this means that the
                        individual modules (units) that developers create are tested on
                        their own. Wider scale testing is usually performed by others later

                        There may, however, be other sources or types of testing that may

                        testing is usually performed by developers during the coding phase
                        of the software development project. When each developer is assigned
                        the task of building a section of an application, the specifications
                        that are given to the developer should include test plans or test
                        cases that the developer will use to verify that the code works
                        properly. This is true regardless of whether the part of the
                        application that the developer is working on will be seen and used
                        by end users or will be buried deep within the bowels of the
                        application and never seen by anyone.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In a formal development environment, the unit test
                        plans should be precise and list each test that the developer should
                        undertake. The developer then performs each of the tests and records
                        the results (usually the actual output) of the test. Those test
                        results are then archived so that they can be referred to later if
                        needed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The archiving of unit testing records sometimes proves
                        valuable when later phases of testing are taking place and some
                        problem is found. Developers trying to isolate the cause of later
                        testing problems can refer back to test plans and results at the
                        unit testing phase to see whether the test plans and other unit
                        testing activities were performed correctly, or whether they
                        contained appropriate test cases. This evidence can save the project
                        team a lot of time by eliminating the need to repeat unit testing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Unit testing should be a part of the development of
                        each module in the application. When a developer is assigned a
                        programming task in a software development project, unit testing
                        should be performed immediately after coding and debugging have
                        taken place. In some organizations, developers work in pairs—the
                        senior developer writes code, and the junior developer performs
                        testing. This gives junior programmers an opportunity to learn more
                        about advanced programming by observing the senior developer and by
                        testing his or her code.</p>

                            be easily argued that unit testing for a software module should
                            not be performed by the developer who wrote the module. The
                            developer may be under time pressure to complete development and
                            testing and may overlook test cases or gloss over errors as
                            irrelevant. Also, a developer can be too familiar with his or
                            her code to be capable of objectively testing it. The
                            methodology of “written by one and tested by another” has the
                            advantage of objective testing, but it can be more difficult to
                            carry out in smaller organizations where only a single developer
                            may be writing all of the code.</p>

                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>System Testing</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
                        various parts of the application are developed and unit-tested, they
                        will be installed into a test environment. When a sufficient number
                        of modules or components has been completed, it will eventually
                        become possible to begin end-to-end (or at least partial end-to-end)
                        testing. In this way, it will be possible to test several components
                        as a whole to verify whether they work together properly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">System testing includes <em>interface testing</em> to
                        confirm that the application is communicating properly with other
                        applications. This will include real-time interfaces as well as
                        batch processing.</p>
                    <p class="indent">System testing also includes <em>migration
                            testing</em>. When one application is replacing another, data
                        from the old application is often imported into the new application
                        to eliminate the need for both old and new applications to function
                        at the same time. Migration testing ensures that data is being
                        properly formatted and imported into the new application. This
                        testing is often performed several times in advance of the real,
                        live migration at cutover time.</p>
                    <p class="indent">As with unit testing, system testing should have
                        pre-prepared test plans that were developed at the system design
                        phase. And as with unit testing, system testing should probably not
                        be performed by the developers who developed the modules under test
                        or by the integrators who set them up in the test environment.
                        Further, system testing results should be formally documented and
                        archived in case they are needed later.</p>

                        primarily concerned with the verification of functional requirements
                        that were developed earlier in the application project.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each functional requirement must be expressed in a way
                        that makes it inherently verifiable. When each functional
                        requirement is developed, one or more tests should also be
                        developed, which are conducted during the functional testing phase
                        of the project.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Functional tests should be formally recorded,
                        including test input and test results. All of this should be
                        archived in case it’s needed if the application is suspected of
                        malfunctioning. Often functional test results can verify whether the
                        malfunction was present during the functional testing before the
                        application went live.</p>

                        is performed. UAT should consist of a formal, written body of
                        specific tests that permits application users to determine whether
                        the application will operate properly.</p>

                        new environment. Often this procedure requires the development of
                        one or more custom programs to extract, convert, and insert the data
                        into the new environment. This procedure is usually performed more
                        than once: it must be rehearsed at least one time to make sure that
                        it works properly. Also, migrated data is often needed for
                        functional testing, UAT, and training before the actual cutover.</p>

                    <p class="noindentt"><strong>Data Migration</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
                        the context of the SDLC, the purpose of a data migration is to
                        transfer data from an older, soon-to-be-retired system to a new
                        system. Depending upon the nature of the old and new applications,
                        the purpose of the data migration may be to make historical records
                        that originated in the older system available in the newer system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">In some cases, an organization will continue to keep
                        the older application running to facilitate access to historical
                        data. In some circumstances, it may require fewer resources to keep
                        the old application running than to migrate the historical data to
                        the new application.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Data migration often requires the development of
                        programs that extract data from the old application, perform
                        required transformations, and then format the data and import it
                        into the new application. This is frequently a complex task, as
                        there may be differences so significant between the data models of
                        the old and new applications that the meaning of stored data differs
                        between them. In some cases, it will be necessary to create some
                        parts of the database in the new application by extracting data from
                        the old application <span id="page_218" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>and
                        then performing calculations to
                        create the data necessary in the new. Careful analysis is required
                        in all cases to make sure that the <em>meaning</em> of data in each
                        application is known so that the migration will be done properly.
                        Following are some techniques and considerations that ensure a
                        successful migration:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Record
                            counts</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programs or utilities should be
                        used to count the number of records in counterpart tables in the old
                        and new environments. This will confirm the completeness of the
                        migration programs that move data from the old environment to the
                        new one.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Batch
                            totals</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data records with numeric
                        values can be added together in the old and new databases. This will
                        help to confirm the integrity of key data elements in the old and
                        new environments.</p>
                    <p class="bull">
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Checksums</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programs
                        that compute checksums can be run against old and new databases to
                        ensure the accuracy of migrated data. Programmers do need to be
                        aware of the methods used to store data, which could lead to
                        differences in checksums. For instance, an address field in one
                        application may pad the field with spaces, but in the other it may
                        be padded with nulls. Also, the way that dates are stored can vary
                        between applications. While using checksums can be valuable,
                        programmers and analysts must be familiar with any differences in
                        data representation between the old and new environments.</p>

                            be analyzed to make sure that they are working properly. Often
                            it is necessary to perform a test migration—well in advance of
                            the scheduled cutover date—to give enough time to make sure that
                            the migration programs have been properly written.</p>

                        has reached the cutover milestone. Often, management review and
                        approval are required to verify that all necessary steps have been
                        completed correctly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Depending upon the nature of the application as well
                        as external influences such as regulation or business requirements,
                        an organization may transfer processing to the new environment in
                        one of several ways:</p>

                            cutover</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization may operate
                        both the old and new applications in parallel for a time, making
                        careful comparisons between old and new to ensure that the new
                        application is working properly.</p>

                            cutover</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an application used
                        throughout large geographic regions, such as a retail point-of-sale
                        application, the organization may migrate individual locations to
                        the new application instead of moving all locations at one time.</p>

                        could move accounts receivable to the new environment, later move
                        accounts payable, and still later move general ledger. During and
                        between each of these phases, the organization must keep track of
                        exactly which business information resides in which system.</p>

                            Planning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes an organization
                        will migrate an application from an old environment to a new one,
                        and shortly afterward will discover a serious problem in the new
                        environment that requires a return to the old environment.
                        <em>Rollback planning</em> is a safety net that provides a
                        last-resort path away from a situation where the organization cannot
                        continue using the new environment.

                    <p class="indent">A rollback is a serious undertaking and would be

                        planning is recommended in environments where the availability and
                        integrity of an application is critical to the organization, even if

                        development was the de facto model used by most organizations.
                        Breakthroughs and changes in technology in the 1970s and 1980s have
                        led to new approaches in software development that can be every bit
                        as effective as the waterfall model and, in many cases, more
                        efficient and faster.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">DevOps</h5>

                        utilizes agile development methodology coupled with tighter
                        integration of development teams, software QA, and IT operations.
                        DevOps isn’t complete without tools facilitating more effective

                        and IT operations are somewhat blurred. It is essential for
                        organizations to ensure that access control models and capabilities
                        continue to support regulatory and compliance requirements such as

                        an improvement to) DevOps. DevSecOps represents the best of DevOps
                        and includes security design and testing capabilities that are a
                        part of the rapid development and automated testing process. Often,
                        static and/or dynamic code-scanning capabilities are integrated into
                        the software build environment so that security defects are
                        identified as soon as possible. Further automated testing can be
                        performed on production environments to reveal exploitable defects
                        that can be remediated by developers in subsequent sprints.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Agile Development</h5>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>Agile</em> development is a software development
                        model and is referred to as an alternate methodology that is
                        appropriate for some organizations. The agile methodology utilizes
                        the Scrum project methodology that is discussed in detail earlier in
                        this chapter. In an agile development project, a larger development
                        team is broken up into smaller teams of five to nine developers and
                        a leader, and the project deliverables are broken up into smaller
                        pieces that can each be attained in just a few weeks.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Prototyping</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">Application <em>prototyping</em> is a methodology
                        whereby rapidly developed application prototypes are developed with
                        user input and continuous involvement. In this method, users work
                        closely with developers who build specific components in short
                        periods and solicit frequent user feedback.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The primary advantage of prototyping is that the risks
                        of the application turning out all wrong are reduced because users
                        are constantly involved and can head off an incorrect approach
                        before more time is wasted.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The main disadvantage of prototyping is that the
                        system is developed based only on what the user sees and knows;
                        other functional requirements that users may be unaware of may go
                        unaddressed, resulting in a system with inadequate controls and
                        resilience.</p>

                        RAD is characterized by the following activities and features:</p>

                    <p class="indent">RAD can almost be thought of as a 1960s-era protest of
                        the political and business establishment. In most cases, it takes
                        the opposite approach to software development from the
                        then-traditional and time-proven (but also inefficient and
                        time-<em>consuming</em>) development models created in the decades

                    <p class="noindent"><em>Data-oriented system development</em> (DOSD) is,
                        as the name suggests, a data-centric software development
                        methodology. In DOSD, data is the central focus, the “hub of the
                        wheel” as it were, and the other development activities occur as a
                        result of data analysis and design.</p>
                    <p class="indent">DOSD is utilized in some of the larger information
                        processing environments that are interconnected by many
                        organizations. For instance, airline reservations systems, merchant
                        and payment processing systems, securities trading systems, medical
                        records processing systems, and cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service
                        (PaaS) vendors such as <a data-savepage-href="http://SalesForce.com"

                        well-defined data models and transaction interfaces. Organizations
                        that want to participate in these larger systems will build their
                        own applications that are focused on the published data interfaces
                        on the systems they want to connect to.</p>
                    <p class="indent">DOSD can be applied to environments that utilize
                        batches of transactions that are, for example, transmitted and
                        processed in bulk, as well as transactions that are performed in
                        real time, such as airline reservations or securities trading.</p>

                    <p class="noindent"><em>Object-oriented</em> (OO) system development is
                        a world unto itself that contains an entire vocabulary to describe
                        objects and many other software components. It is so different from
                        traditional structured programming (such as FORTRAN, BASIC, and C)
                        that it has its own languages and even databases if you want to
                        implement one.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Entire books (and even series of books) have been
                        written on OO development and technology. I will summarize the basic
                        vocabulary and activities here.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><span id="page_224" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>The
                        basic unit of OO technology is the <em>class</em>. A class describes
                        the characteristics of an object, including its attributes,
                        properties, fields, and the methods it can perform.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The instantiation of a class is called an
                        <em>object</em>. You could think of a class as stored code and
                        configuration, and when it’s running, the part that is running is
                        the object.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">A <em>method</em> refers to the actions that an object
                        can perform. If, for instance, an object is written to calculate the
                        interest on a loan, the method is the software code in the object
                        that performs the calculation. In other programming languages,
                        subroutines and functions are basically the same thing as a method
                        in OO.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Objects routinely employ another technique known as
                        <em>encapsulation</em>. This is a common practice whereby any
                        particular method may call other methods to perform its work. This
                        is similar to a function calling another function. The point of
                        encapsulation in OO is that the software developer does not need to
                        know anything about the implementation details of a method,
                        including whether it calls other methods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">At the beginning of this narrative I mentioned a
                        class. OO frequently has a hierarchy of classes. A class can belong
                        to a parent class, and in turn, a class can contain subclasses. But
                        parent classes and subclasses are not just ways of arranging or
                        storing classes. Instead, the relationship of classes is functional.
                        The attributes of a parent class are passed down through
                        <em>inheritance</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Earlier I stated that when a class is instantiated, it
                        becomes an object. Depending on the data that is passed on to the
                        object, it may behave in different ways. This characteristic is
                        known as <em>polymorphism</em>. For example, a class that computes
                        shipping charges will behave in different ways, depending upon the
                        source and destination addresses as well as on special circumstances
                        such as customers. In this case, polymorphism is not just about the
                        rate that is chosen for shipping, but possibly other objects will be
                        called, such as objects to handle customs, taxes, or hazardous
                        materials declarations.</p>
                    <p class="indent">OO programming and operational environments will have
                        one or more <em>class libraries</em>. These take many forms,
                        depending upon the operating system, languages, and subsystems that
                        are in use. For instance, in the Java language, class libraries are
                        stored in JAR (Java ARchive) files that are located on the system
                        where programs can refer to them when needed.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Component-Based Development</h5>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>Component-based development</em> is an approach
                        that reflects the software architecture of an application. Here, an
                        application environment will be made up of several independent
                        components, often located on different physical or virtual systems,
                        which work together.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, a large application environment may
                        consist of a group of centrally located servers that process primary
                        transactions. These servers may contain interfaces, using standard
                        interface technologies such as CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
                        Architecture), RPC (Remote Procedure Call), or SOA (Service-Oriented
                        Architecture), with which other parts of the overall application
                        environment may communicate. For instance, auxiliary components such
                        as batch input and output, data warehouses, static table updates
                        (such as tax or shipping rates), and client programs may all be
                        independent applications that communicate with the core system.</p>

                            especially true of modern distributed applications, PaaS
                            environments, and web-based mashups, where applications may

                    <p class="noindent">The creation of the HTML content-display standard
                        and the HTTP communications protocol has revolutionized application
                        development. The web browser is ubiquitous and has become the
                        universal client platform that is not unlike an intelligent display
                        terminal from earlier eras.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Web, as it is popularized now, came along just in
                        time: two-tier and three-tier client-server computing, the great new
                        application development paradigm that was developed in the 1990s,
                        was not living up to its promise, particularly in the areas of
                        performance and upkeep of client software. Web software has
                        dramatically simplified software development from the perspective of
                        the user interface (UI); though the developer has a little less
                        control over what and how data will be displayed on a user
                        workstation, the trade-off in not having to maintain client-side
                        software is viewed as acceptable.</p>
                    <p class="indent">From a development methodology perspective, web
                        application development can be performed within virtually all of the
                        development frameworks, including waterfall, DevOps, agile, RAD,
                        DOSD, and OO (all discussed in this chapter). Primarily it’s the
                        target technology that differentiates web-based application
                        development from its alternatives.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Important standards have been developed that
                        facilitate communications between web-based applications, including
                        JSON-RPC, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), and Web Services
                        Description Language (WSDL). JSON-RPC is an XML (eXtensible Markup
                        Language)–based protocol coded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
                        used by a client system to request a method of a remote system.</p>
                    <p class="indent">SOAP is an XML-based application programming interface
                        (API) specification that facilitates real-time communications
                        between applications using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
                        Functionally, SOAP operates similarly to RPC, wherein one
                        application transmits a query to another application, and the other
                        application responds with a query result. SOAP messages are based in
                        the XML standard.</p>
                    <p class="indent">WSDL serves as a specification repository for the SOAP
                        services available in a particular environment. This permits an
                        application to discover what services are available on an
                        application server.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Reverse Engineering</h5>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>Reverse engineering</em> is the process of
                        analyzing a system to see how it functions, usually as a means for
                        developing a similar system or for learning about how the system
                        works. Reverse engineering usually requires tools that examine
                        computer binary code and that build a programming language
                        equivalent.</p>

                        engineering can help to
                        speed up a development project where an organization needs to build
                        an application that is similar to another in its possession that
                        exists in binary format only. Without reverse engineering, the
                        organization would have to spend additional time in the software
                        design and development phases of the project.</p>
                    <p class="indent">This practice is usually forbidden in software license
                        agreements, because using it would reveal protected intellectual
                        property that could economically damage the original software maker.

                    <p class="noindent">Application developers can create source code using
                        tools ranging from simple text editors to advanced tools such as
                        computer-aided software engineering and fourth-generation languages
                        (4GLs). While there’s little reason to discuss text editors such as
                        vi, Notepad, or Emacs, advanced development tools are worth your
                        attention and are discussed in this section.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Integrated Development Environment</h5>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>Integrated development environments</em> (IDEs)
                        are a class of desktop software development tools that incorporates
                        source code editing, source code version control, compilation, and
                        debugging in a single tool. An IDE enables a developer to write,
                        test, and debug code without having to switch between programs.</p>
                    <p class="indent">IDEs typically have multiple windows, or panes, that
                        enable the software developer to view and edit code, run code and
                        observe execution, and view the source code library. Other functions
                        may be available as well.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Some IDEs have built-in security capabilities such as
                        code analysis, as well as connectivity to external tools such as
                        source code scanning tools that look for security defects.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Computer-Aided Software Engineering</h5>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>Computer-aided software engineering</em> (CASE)
                        represents a broad variety of tools used to automate various aspects
                        of application software development. CASE tools cover three basic
                        realms of development:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Upper
                            CASE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes activities ranging
                        from requirements gathering to the development of data models, data
                        flow diagrams, and interfaces.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Middle
                            CASE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves the development of
                        detailed designs, including screen layouts, report definitions, data
                        design, and data flows.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Lower
                            CASE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves the creation of
                        program source code and data schemas.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><span id="page_227" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>These
                        terms are loosely used to classify various CASE tools. Some CASE
                        tools are strictly Upper CASE, while others include Middle CASE
                        and/or Lower CASE, but many cover the entire range of functionality
                        and can be used to capture specifications, create data structure and
                        flow diagrams, define program functions, and generate source code.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">CASE tools do not usually create source code that is
                        ready for implementation and testing. Instead, they are used to
                        create the majority (in the best cases) of code for a given program;
                        then the developer(s) would add details and specific items that the
                        CASE tool did not cover. CASE tools are not used to replace the work
                        of a developer, but to help make the coding part of a development
                        project take less time, to improve consistency, and to enhance
                        program quality.</p>
                    <p class="indent">CASE tools often contain <em>code generators</em> that
                        create the actual program source code.</p>

                            of the SDLC. With or without CASE tools, it is still necessary
                            for a project team to create requirements, specifications, and
                            design. CASE does help to automate some of these activities,
                            however.</p>

                    <p class="noindent"><em>Fourth-generation languages</em>, or 4GLs,
                        comprise a variety of tools that are used in the development of
                        applications or that are parts of the applications themselves.</p>
                    <p class="indent">There is no universally accepted definition for 4GLs,
                        unlike with first-, second-, and third-generation languages. 4GLs
                        were developed independently by many different organizations and
                        researchers, and they carry a diversity of concepts that contributes
                        to the inability to describe all of them in a single definition.
                        Common among nearly all of the 4GLs and tools is that they are
                        event-driven rather than procedure-driven, and they are less
                        detailed than procedural languages.</p>
                    <p class="indent">4GLs are most often used as adjuncts to applications
                        rather than for their core functionality. For instance, 4GLs are
                        useful for report generators, query generators, and other higher
                        level functions. 4GLs are typically designed for use by nontechnical
                        users who have few or no programming skills. 4GLs can also be used
                        by developers as code generators.</p>

                        Implementation</h3>
                    <p class="noindent">Infrastructure is used to connect applications to
                        users and to other applications. Infrastructure is composed of the
                        networks, servers, storage systems, and other facilities that
                        support the use of applications.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While an organization may be able to acquire
                        off-the-shelf or SaaS software for many of its core business
                        activities, infrastructure is almost always custom-architected and
                        integrated for the organization. Whereas software applications are
                        like the tools in <span id="page_230" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>the
                        hand of an astronaut, the
                        infrastructure is like the astronaut’s glove, which must be
                        tailor-made to fit each astronaut’s hand. Infrastructure needs to
                        conform to the organization’s geography, business model, security
                        requirements, regulatory requirements, and culture.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Formal processes are required to design and develop
                        infrastructure that is sure to meet the organization’s needs. This
                        section describes the detailed process of the infrastructure
                        development life cycle that is needed to ensure that the
                        infrastructure will adequately support the use of applications and
                        other IT facilities and tools.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In the context of business applications and
                        information systems, infrastructure is the collection of networks,
                        network services, devices, facilities, and system software that
                        facilitate access to, communications with, and protection of those
                        business applications. For instance, a user who wants to access a
                        business application uses a workstation that is connected to a local
                        area network (LAN). To access the business application, the
                        workstation communicates over networks formed with routers,
                        switches, firewalls, and cabling. All of that “in-between” equipment
                        and cabling constitutes infrastructure.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Infrastructure facilitates the communication and use
                        of applications. Without infrastructure, applications cannot
                        function or be accessed by users. Since infrastructure is so vital,
                        its construction and maintenance requires the same level of
                        formality and process as the business applications that it supports.
                        In newer organizations, however, infrastructure serves only to
                        connect workstations to the Internet and to facilitate a few
                        business location services such as document scanning and printing.

                        it is essential to know precisely what is expected of the
                        infrastructure in terms of specific features and capabilities. An
                        analyst or project team should develop specific requirements in a
                        number of categories:</p>
                    <p class="bullt">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Business functional
                            requirements</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These specify what the
                        addition or change to the infrastructure is expected to do. For
                        instance, networks or network services will be expected to support
                        new or improved communications between users and applications,
                        remote access, communications to service providers, or services
                        between applications. Or segmentation may be planned to isolate a

                        infrastructure. Additions or changes to infrastructure should

                        LDAP (used for authentication and authorization), product standards
                        for devices such as routers and switches, and other standards that
                        will permit the new infrastructure to work harmoniously with
                        existing infrastructure with the smallest possible increases in
                        support costs. Technical requirements for infrastructure should also
                        include performance requirements such as availability, latency, and
                        throughput so that the infrastructure will have the capacity to

                        administrative support. When an environment is being expanded or
                        upgraded, generally the new components will need to work with the
                        same support and management methods that are used for existing
                        infrastructure, except when the infrastructure change has to do with
                        a change in these features.</p>

                        needed and can configure them to support business needs. If software
                        or hardware vendors will be asked to make suggestions on the
                        components required for the infrastructure, then the design must be
                        detailed enough so that they can make appropriate recommendations

                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev129">Procurement</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">More often than not, additions or changes to
                        infrastructure involve the procurement of infrastructure hardware
                        and/or software.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Request for Proposals</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">Any significant expansion or upgrade to
                        infrastructure may require the use of a <em>request for
                            proposals</em> (RFP). This is a formal process whereby the
                        organization gathers all business and technical requirements and
                        forwards them to several qualified vendors, who produce formal
                        written proposals that include detailed information on the equipment
                        and services required to perform the upgrade. Some organizations
                        require the RFP process to be used for any purchases that exceed a
                        set amount.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When the project team receives RFP responses, the
                        responses must be evaluated to determine which vendors are capable
                        of meeting the organization’s business and technical needs. The
                        project team may also need to evaluate one or more of the vendors’
                        solutions to “see for themselves” whether each vendor’s proposed
                        solution will successfully meet the organization’s needs.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The <em>request for information</em> (RFI) process is
                        similar to that of RFP, except that the primary request is not for
                        business proposals, but instead for information that will help the
                        organization select solutions.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Evaluation</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">If the project team will be evaluating potential
                        solutions, the team will need to provide whatever facilities are
                        required to house the equipment or software. The project team will
                        also need to take whatever time is required to test the components
                        to determine whether they can support business needs. This may
                        require the team to provide other equipment to set up an end-to-end
                        test.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each of the business and technical requirements needs
                        to be verified. This will require that one or more project team
                        members work with the equipment being evaluated to see how that
                        equipment works. A test checklist should be developed that has a
                        one-to-one <span id="page_233"
                            epub:type="pagebreak"></span>correspondence to each business and
                        technical requirement. This will permit project team members to rate
                        each feature from each vendor in an objective manner.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev130">Testing</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Before new infrastructure—or significant changes to
                        existing infrastructure—can be made available for production users,
                        the infrastructure should be formally and thoroughly tested. This
                        helps to confirm that the infrastructure was built correctly and
                        that it will be reliable and secure.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each functional and technical requirement that was
                        developed earlier needs to be systematically verified. This means
                        that a detailed test plan needs to be developed that uses functional
                        and technical requirements as a source. For instance, if a technical
                        standard requires a specific routing protocol configuration setting,
                        then a network engineer on the project team needs to verify whether
                        network devices support that feature (a matter such as this should
                        have been settled during requirements development).</p>
                    <p class="indent">Most organizations do not have a test network
                        environment that completely mirrors their production network. This
                        means that some of the testing needs to be creative, and some
                        testing and verification can’t be done until implementation time.
                        The project team will need to discuss the hard-to-test
                        characteristics of the new infrastructure and decide the best course
                        of action that facilitates the greatest amount of testing and the
                        lowest risk of project failure. In other words, the results of some
                        testing won’t be known until the new infrastructure goes live.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Tests that cannot be done until implementation will
                        become part of the verification that implementation was performed
                        correctly.</p>

                        <h5 class="h5">Proof of Concept</h5>
                        <p class="noindent">Because integration issues are often complex,
                            organizations are turning to the <em>proof of concept</em> to
                            evaluate a proposed new technology or system. In a proof of
                            concept, the organization asks an infrastructure vendor,
                            value-added reseller, or consultant to set up components in the
                            organization’s environment and perform some simple integrations
                            with existing systems. This helps the organization to better
                            understand the likely answer to the question, “Will this new
                            technology work in <em>our</em> environment?” before committing
                            to a particular solution.</p>
                        <p class="indent">The project team should carefully plan the proof
                            of concept so that key features can be demonstrated. A proof of
                            concept is usually performed over a relatively short period, and
                            only a small proportion of integration will be performed. Also
                            remember that the vendor is providing the proof-of-concept
                            hardware and resources without compensation (but with the hope
                            that its solution will be chosen); there is only so much that a
                            vendor will be willing to do for free. Of course, the vendor or
                            an integrator will be able to provide additional integrations
                            for a fee. This is why it is important to identify the key,
                            measurable objectives before the proof of concept is carried
                            out.</p>

                    <p class="noindent">When evaluation and testing are complete and all
                        obstacles and issues have been satisfied, the new infrastructure (or
                        changes to existing infrastructure) can be implemented. This may
                        involve the physical installation of cabling, devices, and other
                        components, as well as the use of common carrier facilities such as
                        communications circuits. In an implementation, the infrastructure is
                        all assembled, tested, and placed into production use.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev132">Maintenance</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Infrastructure requires periodic maintenance,
                        usually in the form of software and hardware upgrades and
                        configuration changes to accommodate changes in the business and
                        technical environments. These changes should be controlled through
                        change management and configuration management processes that are
                        described in detail earlier in this chapter and in the following

                    <p class="noindent">The job is only half done when an application or
                        system has been implemented. Like any system with moving parts
                        (whether real or virtual), information systems and the environments
                        that support them require frequent maintenance. There are dual
                        aspects to system maintenance: business processes and changes to
                        technology. This is embodied in the change management and
                        configuration management processes discussed here.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev134">Change Management</h4>
                    <p class="noindent"><em>Change management</em> is a formal process
                        whereby every proposed and required change to an environment must be
                        formally requested, reviewed, and approved before it is made. The
                        purpose of change management—which is also known as <em>change
                            control</em>—is to identify and reduce risks associated with
                        changes to an IT environment. Change management also helps to reduce
                        unscheduled downtime in an environment. The typical components in a
                        change management process are</p>

                            request</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requestor describes, in
                        structured detail, the desired change. The change request should
                        include the business reason for the change, a procedure for making
                        the change, who will make the change, and who will verify the change
                        (this should be two different individuals or groups); a procedure
                        for verifying that the change was made properly, when the change
                        will be made, and a plan for backing out of the change if it is
                        unsuccessful; and results from test implementations in a testing
                        environment. The request should be distributed to all stakeholders
                        to give them time to read and understand the change.</p>

                        (usually called the <em>change advisory board</em>, or CAB) meets to
                        discuss the requested change. The person or group proposing the
                        change should describe the change and why it is being made, and he
                        or she should be able to answer questions from others about the
                        change and its impact. If the stakeholders agree that the change may
                        proceed, the change is approved.</p>

                        it has produced the desired result. If the change takes too long, or
                        if the change cannot be successfully verified, the organization
                        “backs out” of the change according to the agreed-upon procedure.

                            changes</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the performance of a
                        change cannot wait until the next scheduled change review,
                        organizations usually provide a process whereby developers or
                        engineers are permitted to make an emergency change. Typically, some
                        management approval is still required; personnel should never be
                        permitted to make changes and then inform others after the fact.
                        Emergency changes still need to be formally reviewed in a change
                        review to ensure that all stakeholders understand what change was
                        made to the environment. A long-term goal that should be realized
                        from managing emergency changes is the reduction in the need to make
                        emergency changes, but a change plan should provide enough
                        information to enable the organization to anticipate situations and

                        to respond to those changes. Two avenues of action need to take
                        place: first is the behavioral aspect, whereby management discusses

                    <p class="noindent"><em>Configuration management</em> (CM) is the
                        combination of a business recordkeeping process and automated
                        tool(s) where the configuration of components in an IT environment
                        is independently recorded. This activity has many potential
                        benefits:</p>

                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
                        configuration information for IT systems is stored independent of
                        the systems themselves, CM information can be used to recover a
                        system or device in the event of a malfunction or failure.</p>
                    <p class="bull">

                        automated tools are used to manage systems and devices in an
                        environment. A CM tool can help an organization drive consistency
                        into the configuration of its systems and devices. This consistency
                        will simplify administration, reduce mistakes, and result in less
                        unscheduled downtime.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">
                        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
                        unexpected behavior and unplanned outages occur, information in a CM
                        system can help with troubleshooting the problem.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Configuration management and change management
                        processes together can help to reduce errors by requiring approval
                        for changes and then by recording them when they are completed.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5">Controlling and Recording Configuration Changes</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">While CM is usually considered a means for recording
                        changes made to a system, it can also be used to control those
                        changes. Typically, this is achieved through the use of tools that
                        control system configuration and through system access controls that
                        prohibit changes that circumvent those tools.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Automated tools are almost always used for CM. These
                        tools include a <em>configuration management database</em> (CMDB)
                        that serves as a repository for every component in an environment
                        and that contains information on every configuration change made to
                        those components. The more sophisticated CM tools also permit their
                        operator to revert a given component to a configuration that existed
                        at any time in the past.</p>

                        Control</h5>
                    <p class="noindent">While controlling and recording changes in an
                        environment is highly valuable for some organizations, CM is not a
                        substitute for the change management process. Instead, CM is the
                        means by which change management–approved changes are carried out
                        and recorded on systems. Change management is the review and
                        approval of changes, while configuration management is used to
                        perform and record changes.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3" id="chlev136">Business Processes</h3>
                    <p class="noindent">Organizations that are mature in their thinking and
                        practices will treat their business processes almost like they do
                        their software: both are carefully designed, constructed, operated,
                        and measured, and any changes that are made for either one should be
                        formally considered. Ongoing processes are measured, and continuous
                        improvement and optimization are carried out over time.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Both software and processes should be considered as
                        structured and procedural. The primary difference between the two is
                        that software directs the processing of information in computers,
                        while processes (usually) direct the activities of personnel.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Organizations that understand this type of approach to
                        processes will control their processes like they control their
                        software: through a life cycle.</p>

                        Business Process Reengineering</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Like software, business processes should not be
                        constructed on a whim, but instead should be carefully planned,
                        designed, and constructed, with the involvement of all concerned
                        parties in the organization. These activities are a part of the
                        <em>business process life cycle</em> (BPLC).
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">The most important component in the business process
                        life cycle is <em>business process reengineering</em> (BPR), which
                        is the set of activities related to the process of making changes to
                        business processes.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A <em>process</em> is a set of procedures that
                        achieves some business purpose or objective. These procedures should
                        be formally documented and usually will require recordkeeping of the
                        activities controlled by the process. The procedures will help
                        ensure that the activities are carried out correctly and
                        consistently. The records produced help to document the activities
                        that occurred as the process was carried out over and over.
                        Depending upon the nature of the process, the records serve as
                        tangible evidence that each activity occurred at specific dates and
                        times, by specific personnel, using specific resources. Records also
                        record details about activities such as money spent, products or
                        services processed or sold, and names of customers or others.
                        Records are also used to create statistics about the process that
                        help management understand how well the process is performing and
                        how it is contributing to overall business goals.</p>
                    <p class="indent">There should be a process to control the creation of
                        new processes as well as changes to existing processes. This process

                    <p class="noindent">Developed at Carnegie Mellon University and now a
                        part of ISACA, the Software Engineering Institute Capability
                        Maturity Model (SEI CMM, often referred to as the CMM) is a
                        conceptual model that helps an organization better understand the
                        maturity of its own processes. This is a necessary step if an
                        organization wants to improve its processes, particularly if the
                        organization is not precisely sure how to begin this improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">The SEI CMM defines five levels of maturity:</p>

                            Initial</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level has no process, no
                        procedures, and no consistency. Success, when it is attained, is
                        achieved through brute force and luck.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Level 2 –
                            Repeatable</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this level of maturity,
                        there is some consistency in the ways that individuals perform tasks
                        from one time to the next, as well as some management planning and
                        direction to ensure that tasks and projects are performed
                        consistently.</p>
                    <p class="bull">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Level 3 –
                            Defined</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization has developed
                        a site-wide, documented software development process that is used
                        for all development projects.</p>

                            –</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Managed</strong> At this
                        level, the documented software development process includes key
                        measurement points used to measure effectiveness, efficiency, and
                        defects. These measurements are performed and reported to management
                        as a part of the life cycle.</p>
                    <p class="bullb">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Level 5 –
                            Optimizing</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this highest level of
                        maturity, the organization has instituted metrics-driven process
                        improvement techniques to bring about continuous improvement in its
                        SDLC.</p>

                        <p class="noindent">Confusion abounds on the topic of process
                            maturity, and few organizations have the right perspective.
                            Here’s the myth: better-run organizations will aspire to improve
                            their business processes until they are at the optimizing
                            level—the top level in the CMM. Instead, consider this: in most
                            organizations, a maturity level of around 3 is sufficient, for
                            the long term. Organizations in some industries such as banking
                            and aerospace should be closer to, or even a little beyond,
                            level 4, managed. Few organizations should aspire to level 5,
                            optimizing. The reason for this is that the cost of operations
                            to rise from level 3 to level 4 is considerable, and for most
                            organizations the amount of risk reduction does not warrant the
                            expense.</p>
                        <p class="indent">The best way for organizations to approach process
                            maturity is to determine the aspirational maturity level of each
                            important business process—not merely a big average figure. In
                            each organization, some processes need to be more mature, and
                            others can acceptably be less mature. Organizations should ask
                            two questions about each business process: how precise should
                            this business process be run, and should we collect measurements
                            on this process so that we can manage and improve it?</p>

                    <p class="noindent">The text of the CSF claims that these tiers are not
                        maturity levels, but upon reading the tier descriptions, it is
                        difficult to come to any other conclusion.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Executive Order (EO) 13636, <em>Improving Critical
                            Infrastructure Cybersecurity</em>, (February 2013) reads,
                        “directed NIST to work with stakeholders to develop a voluntary
                        framework—based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices—for
                        reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure” (NIST, 2018). While
                        required for implementation within the U.S. Federal Government, the
                        CSF is voluntary guidance for private, commercial, and other
                        organizations. It is heavily integrated into the latest version of
                        the Risk Management Framework (RMF) (version 2, as of December
                        2018), and is essentially a catalog of cybersecurity activities.
                        These activities are outcome-based and describe desired outcomes
                        from performing these activities. As of the writing of this book,
                        the current version of the CSF is 1.1, released in April 2018.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The CSF consists of 5 activities or
                        <em>functions</em>, further broken down into 23 categories and 108
                        subcategories. Each of these is also matrixed with 5 Informative
                        References—CIS, COBIT, ISA, ISO/IEC 27001, and NIST SP
                        800-53—although obviously the emphasis throughout is on the NIST
                        control catalog. All of this together is referred to as the CSF
                        <em>core</em>. The mapping to CIS, COBIT, ISA, ISO 27001, and NIST
                        800-53 alone makes the CSF a valuable reference tool.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">The five CSF functions are Identify (ID), Protect
                        (PR), Detect (DE), Respond (RS), and Recover (RC). Each of these
                        functions dictates how a mature cybersecurity life cycle can be
                        developed to protect an organization and its assets. These are
                        essentially the functions and activities an organization performs on
                        a daily basis to protect its assets and minimize or respond to risk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">A CSF tier is “the degree to which an organization’s
                        cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the characteristics
                        defined in the Framework” (NIST, 2018). The four tiers range from
                        Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4). The three areas that are
                        measured for maturity in the CSF are the Risk Management Process
                        (degree of rigor), the Integrated Risk Management Program (how well
                        cybersecurity risk decisions are integrated into broader risk
                        decisions), and the level of External Participation (the degree to
                        which the organization shares and receives cybersecurity info from
                        external parties).</p>
                    <p class="indent">For implementation in the private sector, the CSF can
                        be customized into profiles. A <em>profile</em> is a particular
                        customization of the CSF core for an organization or sector; it is
                        based on the organization’s or sector’s unique requirements. NIST
                        publishes profiles for a variety of industry sectors, such as the
                        manufacturing and petroleum industries.</p>

                    <p class="noindent">The suppliers, vendors, service providers, and
                        business partner organizations that assist the organization in the
                        realization of its objectives are known as <em>third parties</em>.
                        The standard of due care for the management of third parties
                        requires that organizations carefully examine each third party
                        during the selection process and thereafter. In response to the
                        trend of outsourcing IT services to third-party organizations, the
                        standard of due care has been steadily increasing. This is necessary
                        to maintain risk parity, so that organizations have a reasonable
                        amount of visibility into cyber-risk matters.</p>

                        individual third parties will also vary. Accordingly, the activities

                    <p class="indent">The answers to these and other questions help
                        organizations better understand various aspects of cybersecurity
                        risk associated with each third-party organization.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev141">Onboarding and Due Diligence</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">An organization typically embarks on a search of
                        third-party service providers to find one or more candidate service
                        providers. The organization will develop objectives and requirements
                        and use these in an evaluation process to determine how successfully
                        each candidate service provider will be able to assist the
                        organization to fulfill its business objectives.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Often, organizations will conduct a formal RFP or RFI
                        process, in which formal business and technical requirements are
                        developed and sent to each candidate service provider. Those service
                        providers will then respond to each requirement. The RFP process is
                        described in more detail earlier in this chapter.</p>
                    <p class="indent">After vetting candidate service providers and making a
                        final selection, the organization should determine the level and
                        type of up-front and periodic (typically quarterly or annual) due
                        diligence that will take place. These <span id="page_244"
                            epub:type="pagebreak"></span>activities should be described in
                        legal agreements between the organization and the chosen third
                        party.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev142">Classification</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Organizations with more than just a few third-party
                        service providers should establish a <em>risk tiering scheme</em> to
                        separate the third parties into similar risk groups. The purpose of
                        this tiering is to serve as a part of a larger program of
                        third-party risk management whereby the organization will determine
                        various types of due diligence for third parties at each risk level.
                        An example tiering scheme is depicted in <a
                            data-savepage-href="ch4.xhtml#ch4tab3"
                            href="https://library/view/cisa-certified-information/9781260458817/ch4.xhtml#ch4tab3">Table
                            4-3</a>. This is a simplistic example; organizations need to
                        develop their own criteria to determine the number and type of risk
                        levels and rules to select a risk tier for each third party.</p>

                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev143">Assessment</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">All third parties need to be periodically assessed,
                        but not all assessments are the same. After risk tiering is used to
                        determine the risk level for each third party, the activities to
                        assess each third party are established. These activities correspond
                        to risk levels; a simplistic example scheme of risk levels and
                        assessments is shown in <a data-savepage-href="ch4.xhtml#ch4tab4"
                            href="https://library/view/cisa-certified-information/9781260458817/ch4.xhtml#ch4tab4">Table

                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev144">Remediation</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">Organizations should expect that the initial and
                        ongoing processes of conducting due diligence on its third-party
                        service providers are not going to proceed perfectly. Occasionally,
                        an organization will discover that the third party is not performing
                        all of the required or desired activities to its liking. At times,
                        these deficiencies may put the organization in jeopardy with
                        regulators.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, an organization may require its top-tier
                        service providers to use two-factor authentication for all remote
                        access; an organization may, through the use of questionnaires or a
                        site visit, discover that the third party is not using two-factor
                        <span id="page_245" epub:type="pagebreak"></span>authentication for
                        remote access. The organization may consider this a serious
                        deficiency and must decide a course of action. Remediation can range
                        from cessation of the relationship to acceptance of the risk.
                        Neither of these is reasonable, but instead the organization
                        generally will seek some middle ground whereby it will compel the
                        third party to enact two-factor authentication for remote access
                        within a reasonable period of time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">In situations where the third party is unable or
                        unwilling to remediate a deficiency, the organization will need to
                        consider its options carefully and find a path of action that brings
                        together the right level of risk and continued business.</p>
                    <h4 class="h4" id="chlev145">Risk Reporting</h4>
                    <p class="noindent">As personnel periodically assess third parties, a
                        bigger picture can begin to form. Often, metrics or a risk dashboard
                        are presented to senior management, so that management can
                        understand where the risk “hot spots” are, as well as trends in
                        third-party risk. This information helps management decide how to
                        manage this important aspect of cybersecurity risk over time.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3" id="chlev146">Application Controls</h3>
                    <p class="noindent">Software applications accept, process, store, and
                        transmit information. Unless specifically programmed and configured,
                        software applications lack the ability to properly distinguish valid
                        and reasonable data from that which is not. Controls are necessary
                        to ensure that information at each stage of processing retains its
                        required integrity.</p>

                                TIP</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exam questions may
                            present a more complex situation than simple input, process, and
                            output controls. Few business processes exist in a vacuum, so
                            many process controls also need to have the full set of internal
                            input, process, and output controls for each subprocess.
                            Test-takers should watch for questions that address application
                            controls that may deal with subprocess requirements, or in which
                            the output of one process is presented as the input for the
                            process under review (affecting which set of controls is
                            appropriate to the question).</p>

                    <p class="indent">While there are marked differences in the architecture
                        of software applications, the typical approach to controls is to
                        apply these controls at the point of entry, processing, and exit. In
                        other words, controls around input data, processing, and output data
                        are needed.</p>
